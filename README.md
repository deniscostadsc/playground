# Playground - A place to play programming.

[![CI](https://github.com/deniscostadsc/playground/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/deniscostadsc/playground/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

In this repository, you'll see my solutions for programming/security
challenges/contest sites. Here you can find my solutions for:

- [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup)
- [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/)
- [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
- [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)
- [SPOJ-br](https://br.spoj.com/)

## Project structure

The following tasks are available in the Makefile:

```shell
make clean  # remove files created by the run task
make languages  # show numbers of solutions in different languages per folder
make lint  # check lint for all solutions
make lint-fix  # format all code
make new-problem FOLDER=path/to/create/  # create solution template
make run  # run and test all past solutions
make run FOLDER=sub/path/to/run  # run and test a specific sub-folder
make run FOLDER=sub/path/to/run LANGUAGE=language-extension  # combine FOLDER and LANGUAGE behavior
make run LANGUAGE=language-extension  # run and test all problems of specific language
make wrong  # show all solutions that are not complete yet
```

Some of these tasks run scripts on the [scripts folder](./scripts/) and Docker
containers from the [.docker folder](./.docker/). Needless to say, these tasks
require [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and
[Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

If you are starting your repo to store your solutions for programming
competition from the scratch, you can use the same structure I have used. You'll
need to copy the following folders and files:

- `.clang-format`
- `.docker/`
- `.flake8`
- `.github`
- `.isort.cfg`
- `Makefile`
- `editor-config`
- `scripts/`

The scripts/CI assume a few things:

- You use a folder for each problem;
- Each problem folder has a `problem.md` file. CI scripts use this file to
  search for problems;
- Each problem folder has an `in.txt` file. That file holds the input test for
  that problem.
- Each problem folder has an `out.txt` file. That file holds expected output to
  test (using [diff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff)) output generated by
  your program;

Bellow, you can see an example of a problem folder structure:
