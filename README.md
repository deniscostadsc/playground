In this repository, you'll see my solutions for programming/security
challenges/contest sites. Here you can find my solutions for:

- [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup)

## Project structure

The following tasks are available in the Makefile:

```
make check-tags  # verify if all tag files have content describing the type of the problem
make check-wrongs  # verify if WRONG files have content explaining which solution is failing and why
make clean  # remove files created by the run task
make get-easiest-problems  # list all complete problems sorted by the sum of number of lines
make languages  # show numbers of solutions in different languages per folder
make lint [LINTS='language extensions']  # check lint for all solutions if no LINTS is passed
make lint-fix [LINTS='language extensions']  # format all code if no LINTS is passed
make new-problem FOLDER=path/to/create LANGUAGE='language extension'  # create solution template
make run [FOLDER=path/to/run] [LANGUAGES='language extensions']  # run solutions
make test  # run the test suite using clitest
make wrong  # show all solutions that are not complete yet
```

Some of these tasks run scripts on the [scripts folder](./scripts/) and Docker
containers from the [.docker folder](./.docker/). Needless to say, these tasks
require [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and
[Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

If you are starting your repo to store your solutions for programming
competitions from scratch, you can use the same structure I have used.
You'll need to copy the following folders and files:

- `.clang-format`
- `.docker/`
- `.flake8`
- `.github`
- `.isort.cfg`
- `Makefile`
- `editor-config`
- `scripts/`

The scripts/CI assume a few things:

- You use a folder for each problem;
- Each problem folder has a `problem.md` file. CI scripts use this file to
  search for problems;
- Problem folders may have an `in.txt` file. That file holds the input test for
  that problem. Some problems don't have input;
- Each problem folder has an `out.txt` file. That file holds expected output to
  test (using [diff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff)) output generated by
  your program;
- All scripts ignore solutions whose folder holds a file named `WRONG`. You
  can create this flag file for solutions that aren't completed yet.

Below, you can see an example of a problem folder structure:
