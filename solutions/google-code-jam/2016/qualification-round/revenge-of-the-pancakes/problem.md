# Revenge of the Pancakes

The Infinite House of Pancakes has just introduced a new kind of pancake! It
has a happy face made of chocolate chips on one side (the "happy side"), and
nothing on the other side (the "blank side").

You are the head waiter on duty, and the kitchen has just given you a stack of
pancakes to serve to a customer. Like any good pancake server, you have X-ray
pancake vision, and you can see whether each pancake in the stack has the
happy side up or the blank side up. You think the customer will be happiest if
every pancake is happy side up when you serve them.

You know the following maneuver: carefully lift up some number of pancakes
(possibly all of them) from the top of the stack, flip that entire group over,
and then put the group back down on top of any pancakes that you did not lift
up. When flipping a group of pancakes, you flip the entire group in one
motion; you do not individually flip each pancake. Formally: if we number the
pancakes 1, 2, ..., N from top to bottom, you choose the top i pancakes to
flip. Then, after the flip, the stack is i, i-1, ..., 2, 1, i+1, i+2, ..., N.
Pancakes 1, 2, ..., i now have the opposite side up, whereas pancakes i+1,
i+2, ..., N have the same side up that they had up before.

For example, let's denote the happy side as + and the blank side as -. Suppose
that the stack, starting from the top, is --+-. One valid way to execute the
maneuver would be to pick up the top three, flip the entire group, and put
them back down on the remaining fourth pancake (which would stay where it is
and remain unchanged). The new state of the stack would then be -++-. The
other valid ways would be to pick up and flip the top one, the top two, or all
four. It would not be valid to choose and flip the middle two or the bottom
one, for example; you can only take some number off the top.

You will not serve the customer until every pancake is happy side up, but you
don't want the pancakes to get cold, so you have to act fast! What is the
smallest number of times you will need to execute the maneuver to get all the
pancakes happy side up, if you make optimal choices?

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases
follow. Each consists of one line with a string S, each character of which is
either + (which represents a pancake that is initially happy side up) or -
(which represents a pancake that is initially blank side up). The string, when
read left to right, represents the stack when viewed from top to bottom.

## Output

For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test
case number (starting from 1) and y is the minimum number of times you will
need to execute the maneuver to get all the pancakes happy side up.

## Limits

- $1 \leq T \leq 100$.
- Every character in S is either + or -.


## Small dataset

- $1 \leq length of S \leq 10$.

## Large dataset

- $1 \leq length of S \leq 100$.

## Sample

### Input

```
5
-
-+
+-
+++
--+-
```

## Output

Case #1: 1
Case #2: 1
Case #3: 2
Case #4: 0
Case #5: 3

In Case #1, you only need to execute the maneuver once, flipping the first (and
only) pancake.

In Case #2, you only need to execute the maneuver once, flipping only the first
pancake.

In Case #3, you must execute the maneuver twice. One optimal solution is to
flip only the first pancake, changing the stack to --, and then flip both
pancakes, changing the stack to ++. Notice that you cannot just flip the bottom
pancake individually to get a one-move solution; every time you execute the
maneuver, you must select a stack starting from the top.

In Case #4, all of the pancakes are already happy side up, so there is no need
to do anything.

In Case #5, one valid solution is to first flip the entire stack of pancakes to
get +-++, then flip the top pancake to get --++, then finally flip the top two
pancakes to get ++++.
