Double Squares

A double-square number is an integer X which can be expressed as the sum of two
perfect squares. For example, 10 is a double-square because 10 = 3^2 + 1^2.
Your task in this problem is, given X, determine the number of ways in which it
can be written as the sum of two squares. For example, 10 can only be written
as 3^2 + 1^2 (we don't count 1^2 + 3^2 as being different). On the other hand,
25 can be written as 5^2 + 0^2 or as 4^2 + 3^2.

Input

You should first read an integer N, the number of test cases. The next N lines
will contain N values of X.

Constraints

0 ≤ X ≤ 2147483647
1 ≤ N ≤ 100

Output

For each value of X, you should output the number of ways to write X as the sum
of two squares.
