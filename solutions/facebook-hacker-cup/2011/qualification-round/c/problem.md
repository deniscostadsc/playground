# Studious Student

You've been given a list of words to study and memorize. Being a diligent
student of language and the arts, you've decided to not study them at all and
instead make up pointless games based on them. One game you've come up with
is to see how you can concatenate the words to generate the lexicographically
lowest possible string.

## Input

As input for playing this game you will receive a text file containing an
integer N, the number of word sets you need to play your game against. This
will be followed by N word sets, each starting with an integer M, the number
of words in the set, followed by M words. All tokens in the input will be
separated by some whitespace and, aside from N and M, will consist entirely
of lowercase letters.

## Output

Your submission should contain the lexicographically shortest strings for
each corresponding word set, one per line and in order.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq N \leq 100$
- $1 \leq M \leq 9$
- $1 \leq all \space word \space lengths \leq 10$
