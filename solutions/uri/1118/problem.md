# Several Scores with Validation

Write an program to read two scores of a student. Calculate and print
the semester average. The program must accepts only valid scores
(a score must fit in the range [0.10]). Each score must be validated
separately.

The program must print a message "novo calculo (1-sim 2-nao)" that means
"new calculate (1-yes 2-no)". After, the input will be (1 or 2). 1 means a
new calculation, 2 means that the execution must be finished.

## Input

The input file contains several positive or negative floating-point (double)
valuesâ€‹. After the input of 2 valid scores, an integer number X will be read.
Your program must stop when X = 2.

## Output

If an invalid score is read, must be printed the message "nota invalida". When
two valid scores are read, the message "media = " must be printed folowed by
the average between these 2 scores. The message "novo calculo (1-sim 2-nao)"
must be printed after reading X. This message should be displayed again if the
standard input number for X is less than 1 or greater than 2, as example below.

The output average must be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point.
