# Honey Reservoir

Julius is the owner of a large apiry situated in Para√≠ba. Every year, every
six months, Julius collect honey produced by bees of their property and stores
it in a CYLINDRICAL container format that facilitates the transport of honey
for establishments who order this natural product for commercialization. Once
Julio realized due to an increase in honey production, over the previous six
months, the container that owned the stand the volume of honey produced by his
bees. Julius needs now that you make a program that informs the volume of
honey in cm3 and the diameter of the inside of the container in cm, calculate
and show:

- What should be the height (in cm) of Inside the container;
- The area (in $cm^2$) of the mouth (entrance) of the container.

NB.: Consider $\pi = 3.14$

## Input

The input contains several test cases and ends with EOF. Each test case
consists of a line containing two floating-point values of double precision
with two decimals after comma, one $V$ ($1.00 \leq V \leq 10000.00$) and one
$D$ ($1.00 \leq D \leq 100.00$), respectively representing the volume and the
container diameter.

## Output

For each test, the output contains the first line "ALTURA = " message, with a
space after ALTURA and another after the symbol of equality, followed by the
container height value with two decimals after comma and the second line
message "AREA = ", also with a space after AREA and another after the symbol
of equality, followed by the value of the area of the mouth (entrance) of the
container with two decimals after comma.

- Do not forget the line break at the end of the exit, otherwise you will get
  "Presentation Error".
