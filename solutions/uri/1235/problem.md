# Inside Out

Your printer has been infected by a virus and is printing gibberish. After
staring at several printed pages for a while, you realize that it is printing
every line inside-out. In other words, the left half of each line is being
printed starting in the middle of the page and proceeding out toward the left
margin. Similarly, the right half of each line is being printed starting at
the right margin and proceeding in toward the middle of the page.

For example, the line:
THIS LINE IS GIBBERISH

is being printed as:
I ENIL SIHTHSIREBBIG S

In the same way, the line " MANGOS " is being printed as "NAM  SOG".Your task
is to unscramble a String line from its printed form back into its original
order. You can assume that line contains an even number of characters.

## Input

The input contains many test cases. The first line of input contains an
integer N that indicates the number of test cases. Follow N lines, each one
with a string with the maximum of 100 uppercase letters ('A'-'Z') and spaces
(' '). that must be unscrambled from its printed form back into its original
order, like example above.

## Output

Each line of input must produce a line of output, with the decoded message,
like example above.
