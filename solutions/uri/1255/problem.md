# Letter Frequency

In this problem we are interested in the frequency of letters in a given line
of text.

Specifically, we want to know the most frequently occurring letter(s) in the
text, ignoring case (to be clear, "letters" refers precisely to the 26 letters
of the alphabet).

## Input

The input contains many test cases. The first line contains an integer N that
indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line
of text. The line may contain non-letter characters, but is guaranteed to
contain at least one letter and less than 200 characters in total.

## Output

For each test case, output a line containing the most frequently occurring
letter(s) from the text in lowercase (if there are ties, output all such
letters in alphabetical order).
