# Combiner

Implement a program Combiner that takes two Strings as parameters and combines
them, alternating letters, starting with the first letter of the first String,
followed by the first letter of the second String, then second letter of first
String, etc. The remaining letters of the longer String are then appended to
the end of the combination String and this combination String is returned.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. The first line of input contain an
integer N that indicates the number of test cases. Each test case is composed
of a line containing two strings and each string contains between 1 and 50
characters, inclusive.

## Output

Combine the two input strings, as shown in the example below and print the
resulting string.
