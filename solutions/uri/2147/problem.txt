One day, the brothers Little Chit√£o and Xor Or Oh, great typists, made a
challenge to see who was the best in typing. For this, they obtained a computer
that does not process keystrokes, ie, if it is to enter the same letter twice
in a row, to press the button twice, as, press for longer, no use. They also
measured the time down a key, which was exactly 1/100 second. The challenge
would be who typed the word "Galopeira" consisting of letters and more, but
both were very good, and arrived at a point that it was not possible to count
how many letters had been typed. Then asked his help to write a program that
checks the typed word and see how much time was spent typing.

Write a program that, given a typed word, tell how much time was spent to be
entered.

Input

An integer C will be informed, which is the amount of test cases. Each case has
a word of at least 9 and at most 10,000 letters.

Output

For each test case, print a T number, which is the time spent, in seconds, to
enter the word of their test case, with precision of two decimal digits.
