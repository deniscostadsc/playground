In the chessboard, the square of the board on line 1, column 1 (upper left
corner) is always white and the colors of the houses alternate between white
and black, according to the pattern known as ... chess! In this way, since the
traditional board has eight rows and eight columns, the house on row 8, column
8 (lower right corner) will also be white. In this problem, however, we want to
know the color of the square of the board in the lower right corner of a tray
with any dimensions: L rows and C columns. In the example of the figure, for
L = 6 and C = 9, the square of the board in the lower right corner will be
black!

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer L (1 ≤ L ≤ 1000) indicating the
number of lines in the chessboard. The second line of the input contains an
integer C (1 ≤ C ≤ 1000) representing the number of columns.

Output

Print a line on the output. The line should contain an integer, representing
the color of the house in the lower right corner of the board: 1, if it is
white; and 0, if it is black.
