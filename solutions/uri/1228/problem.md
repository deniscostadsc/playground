# Start Grid

Nlogonia will hold the sensational world final of the Formula 17
drivers championship. Competitors line up at the start and compete
for the race. You will have access to the start and finish grids. The
question is to determine the minimum number of overtakes that were made
during the competition.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. Each test case uses three lines. The
first line of a test case contains an integer $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 24$)
indicating the number of competitors. Each competitor is identified by a
number from 1 to N. The second line contains the N competitors in order of the
starting grid. The third line of each case has the same competitors, but now
in the order they finish the race.

## Output

For each test case print a line containing a single integer, the minimum
number of overtakes necessary to get from the starting grid to the finishing
grid.
