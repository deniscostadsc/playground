I Can Guess the Data Structure!

There is a bag-like data structure, supporting two operations:

1 x
Throw an element x into the bag.

2
Take out an element from the bag.

Given a sequence of operations with return values, you're going to guess the
data structure. It is a stack (Last-In, First-Out), a queue (First-In,
First-Out), a priority-queue (Always take out larger elements first) or
something else that you can hardly imagine!

Input

There are several test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing a
single integer n (1 <= n <= 1000). Each of the next n lines is either a type-1
command, or an integer 2 followed by an integer x. That means after executing
a type-2 command, we get an element x without error. The value of x is always
a positive integer not larger than 100. The input is terminated by end-of-file
(EOF). The size of input file does not exceed 1MB.

Output

For each test case, output one of the following:

stack

It's definitely a stack.

queue

It's definitely a queue.

priority queue

It's definitely a priority queue.

impossible

It can't be a stack, a queue or a priority queue.

not sure

It can be more than one of the three data structures mentioned above.
