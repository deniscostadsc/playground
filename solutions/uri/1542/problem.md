# Reading Books

You've started compete against your friend to see who can read more books in
less time. Your friend used to read much more fast than you, until the day you
realized that he'd read only small books.

So, you've decided count how many pages each book has. And decide increase the
amount of pages read per day. Now you read 5 pages per day and finish 16 days
before, if you were reading 3 pages per day. In this case, how many pages has
the book?

## Input

The input has many test cases. Each test has tree numbers $Q$ ($0 < Q < 20$),
$D$ ($0 < D < 20$) and $P$ ($0 < P < 20$) separated by one blank space. $Q$
means the amount of pages read per day. $D$ is the number of days you could
speed up, if you were reading the amount of pages $P$. An unique 0 (zero)
value means end of inputs.

## Output

For each test case should be printed how many pages the book has. Use plural
appropriately in Portuguese ("pagina" or "paginas"). This number should be an
integer and truncated - no rounding.
