In each stage of the Jumping Frog game you must safely get your amphibian
through a sequence of pipes of different heights to the rightmost pipe.
Nevertheless the frog just survives if the height difference of consecutive
pipes is at most the frog jump height. If the next pipe height is too high, the
frog hits the pipe and fall. If the next pipe height is too low, the frog does
not survive the fall. The frog always starts on the top of the leftmost pipe.

In this game the distance of pipes is irrelevant, which means that the frog
always can reach the next pipe with a jump.

You must write a program that, given the pipe heights and the frog jump height,
show if the game stage can be beaten or not.

Input

The input is given in two lines. The first one has two positive integer numbers
P and N, the frog jump height and the number of pipes
(1 ≤ P ≤ 5 and 2 ≤ N ≤ 100). The second line has N positive integer numbers
that indicate the pipes heights ordered from left to right. There are no height
greater than 10.

Output

The output is given in a single line. If the frog can reach the rightmost pipe
write "YOU WIN". If the frog fails, write "GAME OVER".
