# Caesar Cipher

Julius Caesar used a system of cryptography, now known as Caesar Cipher, which
shifted each letter 2 places further through the alphabet (e.g. 'A' shifts to
'C', 'R' shifts to 'T', etc.). At the end of the alphabet we wrap around, that
is 'Y' shifts to 'A'. We can, of course, try shifting by any number.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. The first line of input contains an
integer N that indicates the number of test cases. Each test case is composed
by two lines. The first line contais a string that is a codified sentence.
This string will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive. Each
character is an uppercase letter ('A'-'Z'), that is the codified sentence to
this modified Caesar Cipher. The second line contains the number of right
shift, this value is between 0 and 25, inclusive.

## Output

Given an encoded text and a number of shifted letters, decode it to the
original sentence, acording to the explanation above and the following
example.
