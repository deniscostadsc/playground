As we know, there's a three-eyed crow. What it isn't well known is that the
three-eyed crow can foresaw the results of Westeros lottery. Meanwhile every
other crow is flying collecting entries for the lottery, the three-eyed crow
already knows the results, and when Bran dreams with the three-eyed crow, the
crow tells him the result. Bran always remember these dreams very well,
however, he can't understand them fast enough to know the result. Your task is
write a program to calculate the result from Bran's dream.

During the dream, the crow blinks many times and screams exactly 3 times. Every
scream corresponds to a result.

Every blink of the crow communicates a binary number. An open eye means 1 and a
closed eye means 0. The left eye is the most significative eye and the right
eye is the least significative eye. Every blink this number is added and when
the crow screams, the sum is a result.

Input

open eye or a closed eye, from left to right.

Remember that the crow has 3 eyes.

The winning numbers at lottery do not exceed 1000.

Output
