# Fuel Spent

Little John wants to calculate and show the amount of liters of fuel spent on
a trip, using a car that does 12 Km/L. For this, he would like you to help
him through a simple program. To perform the calculation, you have to read
time spent (in hours) and the same average speed (km/h). This way you can
get distance and then calculate how many liters would be needed. Print the
result rounded to three decimal places.

## Input

The input file contains two integers. The first one is the time spent in the
trip (in hours). The second one is the average velocity during the trip
(in Km/h).

## Output

Print how many liters would be needed to do this trip, with three digits
after the decimal point.
