# Paula's Mathematic Game

Paula loves math. Her main hobby is to inventing games or activities to play
with her friends. Obviously, not all of them are so passionated about
mathematics and have a lot of difficulty to solve the games offered by her.
Now Paula has invented a small hobby that involves three characters: a
numerical digit, one letter and one numeric digit.

If the letter is uppercase, you need to subtract the first digit of the second
one. If the letter is lowercase, both digts must be added. If the DIGITS are
the same, the product between these two digits must be presented. She asked
his friend Marcelo, who is good at programming, to create a program that print
the solution for each sequence created by Paula.

## Input

The input contains many test cases. The first line of each input contains a
single integer N, indicating the number of following test cases. Each test
case is a sequence of three chars created by Paula. This sequence contains in
the first position a character between '0' and '9', a uppercase or lowercase
character and another character between '0' and '9'.

## Output

For each test case, one line must be printed with  the solution for each
sequence created by Paula
