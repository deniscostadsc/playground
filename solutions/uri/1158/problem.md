# Sum of Consecutive Odd Numbers III

Read an integer N that is the number of test cases that follows. Each test
case contains two integers X and Y. Print one output line for each test case
that is the sum of Y odd numbers from X including it if is the case. For
example:

for the input 4 5, the output must be 45, that is: 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13

for the input 7 4, the output must be 40, that is: 7 + 9 + 11 + 13

## Input

The first line of input is an integer N that is the number of test
cases that follow. Each test case is a line containing two integer
X and Y.

## Output

Print the sum of all consecutive odd numbers from X.
