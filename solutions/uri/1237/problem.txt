Find the longest common substring between the two informed Strings. The
substring can be any part of the String, including the entire String. If there
is no common substring, return 0. The search is case sensitive ('x' != 'X').

Input

that contains a string each. Both input Strings will contain between 1 and 50,
inclusive, letters (a-z, A-Z), and/or spaces.
