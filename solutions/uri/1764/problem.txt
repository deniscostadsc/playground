Before Santa Claus begin his travels in Brazil to deliver Christmas presents,
he asked you to help him drawing a map with all the cities that he should
visit. Follows the rule to draw this map: the sum of all routes (distances
between two cities) existing on the map should be as small as possible and must
be possible to arrive in any destination from any origin. Claus does not mind
to go to a particular city more than once, as long as it uses only the routes
drawn on the map.

Input

The input file contains several test cases. Each test case starts with two
numbers M (2 ≤ M < 40000) and N (1 ≤ N < 50000), the number of cities and the
number of roads respectively. Input is terminated by M = N = 0. Then follow N
integer triples X (0 ≤ X), Y (Y < M) and Z (1 ≤ Z ≤ 999), specifying that there
will be a bidirectional route between X and Y with Z kilometers, considering
that X ≠ Y and the total sum of all routes in each map is less than 2^31.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer indicating the sum of all distances
or routes of your map.
