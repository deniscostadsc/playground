# Regular Simple Polygons

In Euclidean geometry, a regular polygon is a polygon that is equiangular (all
angles are equal in measure) and equilateral (all sides have the same length).
A simple polygon is one that does not intersect itself anywhere. Below we can
see various mosaics made of regular polygons.

You must write a program that, given the number and the length of sides of a
regular polygon, show its perimeter.

## Input

The input are two positive integers: $N$ and $L$, which are, respectively, the
number of sides and the length of each side of a regular polygon
($3 \leq N \leq 1000000$ and $1 \leq L \leq 4000$).

## Output

The output is the perimeter P of the regular polygon in a single line.
