# Grains in a Chess Board

The queen requested the services of a monk and told him she would pay any
price. The monk, needing food, asked the queen if the payment could be made in
wheat grains arranged in a chessboard, so that in the first square it would be
put only one grain, and in the subsequent squares twice as much as its
previous square. The queen considered it a bargain and asked to the service be
done. However, one of the riders who was present was good in math and warned
that it would be impossible to execute the payment, because the amount of
grain needed would be very high. The Queen then asked this gentleman who was
good in calculation to develop a program that receives as input the number of
squares to be used in a checkerboard and informs the amount of corresponding
kg of wheat, knowing that 12 grains of the cereal correspond to one gram.
Finally, the calculated amount should fit into an unsigned 64-bit integer
number.

## Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$
($1 \leq N \leq 100$), indicating the number of test cases. Each test case
contains a single integer $X$ ($1 \leq X \leq 64$), indicating the number of
possible squares to be used.

## Output

For each test case, print the quantity expected to be received by the monk,
according to the following example.
