A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...

After the decline of the Empire, scavengers are spread around the universe
looking for a lost lightsaber. Everyone knows that a lightsaber emits an unique
wave pattern: 42 surrounded by 7 all around. You have a wave sensor that scans
a terrain with N x M cells. Look at the example below for an 4 x 7 terrain with
a lightsaber in it (at position (2,4)).

11 12  7  7  7 13 14
15  6  7 42  7  7 42
98 -5  7  7  7 42  7
-1 42  3  9  7  7  7

You must write a program that, given an N x M terrain, looks for the lightsaber
pattern in it. No scan have more than one lightsaber pattern.

Input

The first line of the input has two positive integers N and M, representing
respectively the number of rows and the number of columns scanned in a terrain
(3 ≤ N, M ≤ 1000). Each of the next N lines have M integers, describing the
values scanned in each cell of the terrain
(-100 ≤ Tij ≤ 100, for 1 ≤ i ≤ N and 1 ≤ j ≤ M).

Output

The output is a single line with 2 integers X and Y separated by one space.
They represent the (X,Y)-coordinate of the lightsaber, if it is found. If the
terrain doesn't have a lightsaber pattern, X and Y are both zero.
