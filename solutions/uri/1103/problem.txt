Daniela is a nurse in a large hospital, which causes her
working shifts to constantly change. To make it  worse,
she has deep sleep, and a difficult time to wake up using
alarm clocks.
 
Recently she got a digital clock as a gift, with several
different options of alarm sounds, and she has hope that
it might help solve her problem. But, lately, she's been
very tired and want to enjoy every single moment of rest.
So she carries her new clock to every place she goes, and
whenever she has some spare time, she tries to sleep, setting
her alarm clock to the time when she needs to wake up. But,
with so much anxiety to sleep, she ends up with some difficulty
to fall asleep and enjoy some rest.
 
A problem that has been tormenting her is to know how many
minutes of sleep she would have if she felt asleep immediately
and woken up when the alarm clock ringed. But she is not very
good with numbers, and asked you for help to write a program
that, given the current time and the alarm time, find out the
number of minutes she could sleep.

Input

The input contains several test cases. Each test case is described
in one line, containing four integers H1, M1, H2 and M2, with H1 : M1
representing the current hour and minute, and H2:M2 representing the
time (hour and minute) when the alarm clock is set to ring
(0≤H1≤23, 0≤M1≤59, 0≤H2≤23, 0≤M2 ≤59).
 
The end of the input is indicated by a line containing only
four zeros, separated by blank spaces.

Output

For each test case, your program must print one line, containing
a single integer, indicating the number of minutes Daniela has to sleep.
