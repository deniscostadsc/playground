# Square Root of 10

The method of periodic continued fractions is one of the many ways to
calculate the square root of a natural number. This method uses as denominator
a repetition for fractions. This repetition can be done by a fixed number of
times.

For example, by repeating 2 times the continued fraction to calculate the
square root of 10, we have the following equation.

Your task is to calculate the approximate value of square root of 10 given the
number N of repetitions.

## Input

The input is a natural number $N$ ($0 \leq N \leq 100$) that indicates the
quantity of denominator repetitions in the continued fraction.

## Output

The output is the approximate value of the square root with 10 decimal places.
