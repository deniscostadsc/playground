# Building Houses

Mr Pi is a famous constructor of Codingland. He needs your help to find out
the best lands in the city to his projects.

For instance, he has a project to build a house of 8 meters for 10 meters but,
the city laws only allow build houses in this neighborhood, in maximum 20% of
total area. All lands in this city are perfectly square. For your information
the house side is showed only for you to know the house's area that will be
built. (E.g: For a house with 1 meters by 10 meters, in a neighborhood that
allows house use 100% of the land, Mr Pi would needed a land with 10 square
meters. The land side in this case, should be 3.163 meters, that truncated it
is 3). Help Mr Pi find out the ideal land for each project.

## Input

The input has many test cases. Each one is made by tree integer numbers $A$,
$B$ and $C$ ($> 0 and \leq 1000$) separated by one blank space. This numbers
are the size of the house ($A$ and $B$) and the maximum percentage allowed to
build in this neighborhood ($C$). An unique 0 (zero) value means end of
inputs.

## Output

Should be printed an integer number, that is the size of the land. This value
should be truncated.
