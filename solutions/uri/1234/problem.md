# Dancing Sentence

A sentence is called dancing if its first letter is uppercase and the case of
each subsequent letter is the opposite of the previous letter. Spaces should
be ignored when determining the case of a letter. For example, "A b Cd" is a
dancing sentence because the first letter ('A') is uppercase, the next letter
('b') is lowercase, the next letter ('C') is uppercase, and the next letter
('d') is lowercase.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. Each test case is composed by one line
that contais a string sentence. This string will contain between 1 and 50
characters ('A'-'Z','a'-'z' or space ' '), inclusive, or at least, one letter
('A'-'Z','a'-'z').

## Output

Turn the sentence into a dancing sentence (like following examples) by
changing the cases of the letters where necessary. All spaces in the original
sentence must be preserved, ie, "sentence" must be converted in "SeNtEnCe".
