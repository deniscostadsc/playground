# Mean Median Problem

The mean of three integers $A$, $B$ and $C$ is $\frac{(A + B + C)}{3}$. The
median of three integers is the one that would be in the middle if they are
sorted in non-decreasing order. Given two integers $A$ and $B$, return the
minimum possible integer $C$ such that the mean and the median of $A$, $B$ and
$C$ are equal.

## Input

Each test case is given in a single line that contains two integers $A$ and
$B$ ($1 \leq A \leq B \leq 10^9$). The last test case is followed by a line
containing two zeros.

## Output

For each test case output one line containing the minimum possible integer C
such that the mean and the median of A, B and C are equal.
