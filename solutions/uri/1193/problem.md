# Base Conversion

The Julian math teacher has marked a test whose content will on to convert
between decimal, hexadecimal and binary numbers. For Julian, this kind of
convertion is one of the most complex things to be done. Regardless of the
time spent for studying these contents, he simple don't understand. So, as you
understand about computing and is a friend of Julian, he asked for your help
to make a program that checks if the conversions made ​​by him are correct.

## Input

The input contains many test cases. The first line of input contains an
integer N indicating the number of test cases that follow, one by line. Each
test case contains a number $X$ ($X > 0$) followed by a Y text with three
characters, indicating if the X number is in binary, decimal or hexadecimal.
Regardless of the format, any of the numbers must fit into a 32-bit integer.

## Output

For each test case, Julian wants that you print the number of the test case
folloed by two lines, that contains the oiginal number converted for each one
of the other two bases. The sequence of the bases of output is always:
decimal, hexadecimal (lowercase) and binary, ie must respect this order
obviously excluding the input format.

Note: should print a blank line after each test case, even after the last test
case.
