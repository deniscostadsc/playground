Péricles has an unique interest in history. With his up-to-date internet
browser chromed fox, he wandered in the most obscure sites about ancient Greek
mythology.

By some type of cosmic irony, Péricles' browser was infected by a malware with
a peculiar characteristic: every time Péricles closed a tab in his browser,
another two opened! However, when Péricles clicked one of the ads (all tabs
were infested with ads), the tab crashed, and no other tabs were opened.

Your taks is to compute the final number of tabs of Péricles's browser, knowing
the initial number of tabs and the actions taken by Péricles. There are two
possible actions: fechou (when Péricles closed a tab) and clicou (when Péricles
clicked on an ad).

Input

The input is initiated by a line containing two integer numbers, N e M
(0 < N, M < 500), representing the initial number of tabs and the number of
actions performed by Péricles. Each subsequent line contains an action (fechou
or clicou). Naturally, the current number of tabs is always greater of equal to
zero.

Output

The output must consist of a line containing the final number of tabs.
