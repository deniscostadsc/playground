# Hidden Message

Some texts contain hidden messages. In the context of this problem, the hidden
message of a text is composed of the first letter from each word in the text,
in the order they appear.

Given a text consisting of only lowercase letters and spaces, return the
hidden message. A word is a maximal sequence of consecutive letters. There may
be multiple spaces between words. The text may start in spaces, end in spaces
or even contain spaces only.

## Input

The input contains many test cases. The first line contains an integer N that
indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line
containing from 1 to 50 characters, that can be lowercase letters (‘a’-‘z’) or
spaces (‘ ’). Watch out for leading and trailing spaces!

Note: In the sample imput, spaces were replaced by small dots (‘·’) to provide
a better understanding of the samples.

## Output

For each test case print the text that is hidden in the input.
