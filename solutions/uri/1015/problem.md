# Distance Between Two Points

Read the four values corresponding to the x and y axes of
two points in the plane, $p1 (x1, y1)$ and $p2 (x2, y2)$ and
calculate the distance between them, rounded to four
decimal places, according to the formula:

Distance = $\sqrt{(x2 - x1) ^ 2 + (y2 - y1) ^ 2}$

## Input

The input file contains two lines with data. The first one
contains two integer numbers, respectly: $x1$, $y1$ and the
second one also contains two integer numbers: $x2$, $y2$.

## Output

Calculate and print the distance, using the above phormula,
with 4 digits after the decimal point.
