# Counting Sheep

You have decided to count sheep to sleep. You are taking too long to fall
asleep and you realized that some of the sheep are repeating! Each one is
identified by a unique integer, thus you can avoid counting repeated ones.

Given the sheep sequence, output how many you really counted, it is, output
the number of distinct ones.

## Input

The first line contains an integer $T$ ($T = 100$*) indicating the number of
test cases.

In the first line of each case we have an integer $N$
($1 \leq N \leq 100$* or $1 \leq N \leq 10^4â€‹$**), indicating the number of
sheep. The next line contains N integers separated by space indicating the
sequence of sheep.

The sheep identifiers will be between 0 and 109, inclusive.

\* For around 90% of the cases;
** For the other cases.

## Output

Output the number of distinct sheep for each test case.
