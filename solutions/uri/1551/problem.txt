Your English teacher loves to bring new stuff to the class, and today it wasn't
different. There is a city, according to your teacher, where the people take
really seriously the way they talk to each other. In particular, when two
people are talking, they think a lot in the sentence that they are going to say
before they say it, so that they can ensure their sentence will be a “full
sentence”, or maybe an “almost full sentence”.

Considering our 26 letters alphabet, a sentence is “full” if, and only if, it
has all the letters of our alphabet in it. In a similar way, a sentence is
“almost full” if, and only if, it is not “full”, but has at least half of the
letters of our alphabet in it. When a sentence is not “full” neither “almost
full”, it is “poorly designed”.

Your teacher gave you a really hard task: given several sentences exchanged
between several people from the quoted city, say in which of the given
categories each sentence fits in.

Input

The first line contains an integer N, indicating the number of test cases to
follow.

Each test case contains one line, containing lowercase letters, white spaces
and/or commas. The number of characters of each line is at least 3 and at most
1000, counting the spaces.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing one of the following sentences:
“frase completa”, when the sentence is considered full; “frase quase completa”,
when the sentence is not considered full, but is considered almost full; or
“frase mal elaborada”, when the sentence is not full neither almost full.
