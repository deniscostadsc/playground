A volleyball coach would like to keep statistics about his team. In every game
he keeps track of the number of services, blocks and attacks of each player, as
well as how many of these services, blocks and attacks were successful (scored
points). Your program must show, with two decimal points what is the total
percentage of services, blocks and attacks by the whole team that were
successful.

Input

Input starts with the number of players N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), followed by the names
of each of these players. Below the name of each player, two rows of integers
are presented. In the first row, the numbers represent the service, blocks and
attack attempts (0 ≤ S,B,A ≤ 10000) by the specific player. In the second row
there is the number of these services, blocks and attacks
(0 ≤ S1 ≤ S; 0 ≤ B1 ≤ B; 0 ≤ A1 ≤ A) that were successful.

Output

The output must contain the total percentage of successful services, blocks and
attacks by the whole team, with two digits after the decimal point, as shown in
the example.
