The popularity of WiFi networks increased the loss rate of data being
transferred, as several environment factors can easily compromise the data
during traffic. The main goal of URI, Unity of Recovery of Information, is to
identify and correct errors in messages being sent through WiFi networks.

The technique used by URI to identify errors is the parity test, which can be
described as follows: Be S a message that is going to be sent from one device
to another. Before S is sent, an extra bit B is added to the end of the binary
representation of S. If S has an even number of bits of value 1, the extra bit
B will have value 0. Otherwise, if S has an odd number of bits of value 1, B
will have value 1. In this way, after the insertion of the bit B, the message S
will have an even number of bits of value 1.

When the receiver gets the message S he counts how many bits of value 1 the
message has. If the quantity is even, it means that the message was transferred
succesfully. Otherwise, it means that the message had a modification and is not
correct.

Your task is to write an algorithm that makes the insertion of the extra bit B
in the message S, ensuring that after the insertion the message S has an even
number of bits of value 1.

Input

Each test case consists of one line containing the message S, which has at
least 1 and at most 100 bits.

Output

Print one line containing the message S with the extra bit B.
