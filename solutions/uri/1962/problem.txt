Raul Seixas sang that he was born 10 thousand years ago and there was nothing
in this world that he cannot know too much. The Mamomas Assassinas band sang
that more than 10 thousand years "have gone by and passed" [sic] since they
have failed at 5th grade. So many past events and professor MC was curious
about what year each of these have happened.

You must write a program that, given a series of how many years have passed,
show, for each number, in what year the event had happened. Remember that you
must indicate if it had happened BC (Before Christ) or AD (Anno Domini). Use
the portuguese A.C. for BC and D.C. for AD according to the output sample.

Input

The input has several lines. The first one has a positive integer number N
(1 ≤ N ≤ 100000). There are N lines after the first one. Each of these N lines
has a single non negative integer T, which indicates how many years have passed
until 2015 AD (0 ≤ T < 231).

Output

The output has N lines. In each one there is the year A in which the
correspondent time T had happened. Look at the sample output.
