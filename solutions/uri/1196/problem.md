# WERTYU

A common typing error is to place the hands on the keyboard one row to the
right of the correct position. So "Q" is typed as "W" and "J" is typed as "K"
and so on. You are to decode a message typed in this manner.

## Input

Input consists of several lines of text. Each line may contain digits, spaces,
upper case letters (except Q, A, Z), or punctuation shown above [except
back-quote (`)]. Keys labelled with words [Tab, BackSp, Control, etc.] are not
represented in the input. You are to replace each letter or punction symbol by
the one immediately to its left on the QWERTY keyboard shown above. Spaces in
the input should be echoed in the output.

## Output

For each input line, print a corresponding output line with the decoded
message.
