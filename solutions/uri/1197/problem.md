# Back to High School Physics

A particle has initial velocity and constant acceleration. If its velocity
after certain time is v then what will its displacement be in twice of that
time?

## Input

The input will contain two integers in each line. Each line makes one set of
input. These two integers denote the value of $v$ ($-100 \leq v \leq 100$) and
$t$ ($0 ≤ t ≤ 200$) ($t$ means at the time the particle gains that velocity).
The end of the input is determined by EOF.

## Output

For each line of input print a single integer in one line denoting the
displacement in double of that time.
