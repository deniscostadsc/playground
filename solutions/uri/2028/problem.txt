Hyam is a guy that loves sequences. He is finding interesting sequences that
even Fibonacci would not have imagined. One day Hyam saw that given a number N,
he could make a sequence like 0 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 …N N N … N. However, Hyam saw
that each value that increased in the sequence number, the total quantity
increases at a factorial rate. In this case, instead of multiplying, you add
the total number of numbers to the sequence with the value of the next number
in the sequence. For example, if N = 2. The correct sequence would be 0 1 2 2,
which is 4 digits. Now, if N = 3, the next number in the sequence would have
the value 3, so the total quantity of numbers in the sequence would bem the
quantiy of numbers with N = 2, which is 4, plus the value of the next number in
the sequence, in this case 3, giving you 7, since the correct sequence for
N = 3 is 0 1 2 2 3 3 3.

Your task is make an algorithm that given a integer N, has as answer the total
quantity of numbers of this sequence and below the complete sequence.

Input

The input consists of several test cases. Each case is composed of an integer
N (0 <= N <= 200) that indicates the last value of the last N numbers of the
sequence numbers. The input ends with end of file (EOF).

Output

The output is in format Case X: N numbers where X is the order of number of
cases and N is the number of numbers that contains the complete sequence, the
next line sequence numbers with a space between them. You are asked to leave a
blank line after each case.
