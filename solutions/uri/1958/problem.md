# Scientific Notation

Floating point numbers can be very long to show. In these cases, it is
convenient to use the scientific notation.

You must write a program that, given a floating point number, shows this
number in scientific notation: always show the mantissa sign; always show the
mantissa with 4 decimal places; use the character 'E' between the mantissa and
the exponent; always show the exponent sign; and show the exponent with at
least 2 digits.

## Input

The input is a double precision floating point number X (according to the IEEE
754-2008 standard). There will never be a number with more than 110 characters
long and more than 6 decimal places.

## Output

The output is the number X in a single line using the scientific notation
detailed above. See the examples below.
