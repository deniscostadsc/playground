# Hot Dogs

In 2012 it was achieved a new world record in the famous Competition Hot Dogs
Nathan: the champion, Joey Chestnut devoured 68 hot dogs in ten minutes, an
increase amazing compared to 62 sandwiches devoured by the same Chestnut in
2011.

Nathan's Famous Corporation restaurant, located in Brooklyn, NY, is
responsible for the competition. They produce delicious hot dogs, world
famous, but when it comes math is they are not as good. They wish to be listed
in the Guinness Book of Records, but they should fill out a form describing
the basic facts of the competition. In particular, they must inform the
average number of hot dogs consumed by participants during the competition.

You can help them? They promised to pay it with one of their tasty hot dogs.
Given the total of hot dogs consumed and the total of participants in the
competition, you should write a program to determine the average number of hot
dogs consumed by participants.

## Input

The input consists of a single line containing two integers $M$ and $P$ ($1
\leq H, P \leq 100$) indicating respectively the total number of consumed hot
dogs and the total number of participants in the competition.

## Output

Your program should produce a single line with a rational number representing
the average hot dogs consumed by the participants. The result should be
written as a rational number with exactly two digits after the decimal point,
rounded if necessary.
