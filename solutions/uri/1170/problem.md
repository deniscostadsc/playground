# Blobs

On the planet Alpha lives the creature Blobs, that eat just half of its supply
of food available all day. Write an algorithm that reads the initial capacity
of the food supply (in Kg), and calculate how many days will pass before Blobs
eat all this supply until left a kg or less.

## Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$
($1 \leq N \leq 1000$), indicating the number of test cases. Each test case
contains a single floating-point number $X$ ($1 \leq X \leq 1000$), indicating
the amount of food available for Blobs.

## Output

For each test case, print one line containing the number of days that blobs
will take to eat all their food supply, followed by the word "dias" that means
days in portuguese.
