# Sum of Two Squares

Which integer numbers can be represented by a sum of two integer squares?

That is the question that your program must respond!

For example, the number 41 can be represented as $(-4)^2 + 5^2 = 41$, but 7
cannot be represented in the same way.

## Input

The input consists of several lines, each line contains an integer with
absolute value less than or equal to 10000.
                                                                                    
## Output

For each line, print "YES" if the number can be represented by a sum of two
integer squares, otherwise print "NO".
