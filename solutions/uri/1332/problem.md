# One-Two-Three

Your little brother has just learnt to write one, two and three, in English.
He has written a lot of those words in a paper, your task is to recognize
them. Note that your little brother is only a child, so he may make small
mistakes: for each word, there might be at most one wrong letter. The word
length is always correct. It is guaranteed that each letter he wrote is in
lower-case, and each word he wrote has a unique interpretation.

## Input

The first line contains the number of words that your little brother has
written. Each of the following lines contains a single word with all letters
in lower-case. The words satisfy the constraints above: at most one letter
might be wrong, but the word length is always correct. There will be at most
1000 words in the input.

## Output

For each test case, print the numerical value of the word.
