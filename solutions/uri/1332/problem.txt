Your little brother has just learnt to write one, two
and three, in English. He has written a lot of those
words in a paper, your task is to recognize them.
Note that your little brother is only a child, so
he may make small mistakes: for each word, there
might be at most one wrong letter. The word length
is always correct. It is guaranteed that each letter
he wrote is in lower-case, and each word he wrote
has a unique interpretation.

Input

The first line contains the number of words that your
little brother has written. Each of the following lines
contains a single word with all letters in lower-case.
The words satisfy the constraints above: at most one
letter might be wrong, but the word length is always
correct. There will be at most 1000 words in the input.

Output

For each test case, print the numerical value of the word.
