# The Return of Radar

Every year after the contest that takes place in Taxiland, contestants and
coaches go to the famous and renowned restaurant Radar. However, the waiters
(always very kind and polite) get overwhelmed due to the amount of people, and
therefore, end up taking a while to serve them.

Contestants or coaches who sit at the ends are the lucky ones, because they
order only once and are served right away, but the others must always order
twice, because the waiters (always very kind and polite) are careless and
easily forget the orders. Besides, there's a superstition going on among the
contestants and coaches that if there's not an even amount of people who don't
sit at the ends, none of the university's teams will win the next contest.

So your task is to determine the sum of the number of orders of each one to
know if it's worth going to Radar. But whatever the result is, remember: it's
always worth going to Radar!

## Input

The input consists of the integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 100$) indicating the
number of test cases and then, $T$ integers $N$ ($3 \leq N \leq 10^4$)
indicating the number of people. The table is rectangular and there will be at
least and at most one person at one end, i.e., if an end is empty, the other
must be occupied, otherwise, the two ends must be occupied, but the number of
people that are not at the ends must always be even. Read input until $T = 0$.

## Output

Print the sum of the number of orders of each person. There's no newline
between the test cases.
