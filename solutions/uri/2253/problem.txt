Rolien and Naej are the developers of a big programming portal. To help the new
site registration system, they requested your help. Your job is write a code
that validates passwords that are registered on the portal, for that you should
be aware for the following requirements:

- The password must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter
and a number;
- It can’t have any punctuation character, accent or space;
- Moreover, the password must be 6 to 32 characters.

Input

The input contains several test cases and ends with EOF. Each line has a string
S, corresponding to the password that is entered by the user at registration.

Output

The output contains a line, which can be "Senha valida.", if the password has
all previously requested requirements, or "Senha invalida.", if one or more
requirements aren’t met.
