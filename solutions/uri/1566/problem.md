# Height

Full of good ideas, now, the Brazilian government decided to create the
"height benefit". This way, you were instructed to survey the height of the
population of various cities and to sort this population in ascending order of
height. You know that the cities that you have to to do this don't have more
than 3 million of people and, according to the IBGE, in these cities, no one
person has more than 230 cm.

## Input

The input contains many test cases. The first line of input contains an
integer $NC$ ($NC < 100$) that indicates the among of test cases, ie. cities.
For each test case, the first line will contain an integer $N$
($1 < N \leq 3000000$), indicating the among of people in the city. The next
line will contain the height of each one of these citizen, in centimeters,
represented by $h$ ($20 \leq h \leq 230$). Each height is separated by a blank
space.

## Output

For each test case, print a line containing all numbers representing the
height of all citizens (in cm) in ascending order, separated by a blank space.

Obs.: The input file is very large, so you need to use fast input and output
methods.
