Everyone is talking about the Jatoba Teacher classes. The MEC representatives
came to the UNIME of Lauro de Freitas to know more details about this new way
of teaching algorithms. In addition, they wanted to select one student to
participate in the OBI-Tec (Olympiad Informatics Technical Level) and represent
Kroton in the competition, because they know that there are the best. To select
the best, they have available a list of the registration number of each student
and their respective notes in the discipline. Your task is to help the Ministry
of Education staff to find students better able to represent the institution
and who knows guarantee your place. If the highest score is not greater than or
equal to 8, you should print "Minimum note not reached" .

Input

The file first contains the number of students (3 <= n <= 100) and then the n
students bearing the registration number (0 < m < 1000000) each, followed by
the note (0 <= note <= 10.0, with 1 decimal place).

Obs .: the notes will not be repeated. In other words, has no chance to have
two students with the same note.

Output

You must print the student's registration number with the highest score or
"Minimum note not reached" (without quotes) if no student has taken greater
note than or equal to 8.
