# The Chosen

Everyone is talking about the Jatoba Teacher classes. The MEC representatives
came to the UNIME of Lauro de Freitas to know more details about this new way
of teaching algorithms. In addition, they wanted to select one student to
participate in the OBI-Tec (Olympiad Informatics Technical Level) and
represent Kroton in the competition, because they know that there are the
best. To select the best, they have available a list of the registration
number of each student and their respective notes in the discipline. Your task
is to help the Ministry of Education staff to find students better able to
represent the institution and who knows guarantee your place. If the highest
score is not greater than or equal to 8, you should print "Minimum note not
reached".

## Input

The file first contains the number of students ($3 \leq n \leq 100$) and then
the $n$ students bearing the registration number ($0 < m < 1000000$) each,
followed by the note ($0 \leq note \leq 10.0$, with 1 decimal place).

Obs.: the notes will not be repeated. In other words, has no chance to have
two students with the same note.

## Output

You must print the student's registration number with the highest score or
"Minimum note not reached" (without quotes) if no student has taken greater
note than or equal to 8.
