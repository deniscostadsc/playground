Mary knows that a Prime Number is a number that is divisible only by 1 (one)
and by itself. For example the number 7 is Prime, because it can be divided
only by 1 and by 7. So she asked you to write a program that reads many
numbers ​​and inform if each one of these numbers are prime or not. But
Patience is not one of the virtues of Mariazinha, so she wants that the
execution of all test cases (instances) created by herself happen at the
maximum in one second, because she hates waiting :>).

## Input

The first input line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 200$),
corresponding to the number of test cases. Follow N lines, each one containig
one integer number $X$ ($1 < X < 2^{31}$) that can be or not a prime number.

## Output

For each test case output the message “Prime” or “Not Prime” according to the
to following example.
