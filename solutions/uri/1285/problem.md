# Different Digits

The inhabitants of Nlogonia are very superstitious. One of their beliefs is
that street house numbers that have a repeated digit bring bad luck for the
residents. Therefore, they would never live in a house which has a street
number like 838 or 1004.

The Queen of Nlogonia ordered a new seaside avenue to be built, and wants to
assign to the new houses only numbers without repeated digits, to avoid
discomfort among her subjects. You have been appointed by Her Majesty to write
a program that, given two integers $N$ and $M$, determines the maximum number
of houses that can be assigned street numbers between $N$ and $M$, inclusive,
that do not have repeated digits.

## Input

Each test case is described using one line. The line contains two integers $N$
and $M$, as described above ($1 \leq N \leq M \leq 5000$).

## Output

For each test case output a line with an integer representing the number of
street house numbers between N and M, inclusive, with no repeated digits.
