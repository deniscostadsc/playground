# Game of The Greatest

Og loves to play with his children. His favorite game is the game of the
greatest, invented by himself. This pastime (there was a lot of available time
to play in the cavemen's era) is played by two players, Og and one of his
children. The rules of the game are as follows: First, the players choose the
number of rounds of the match. During a round, each player yells a number
between 0 and 10. The player who yells the greatest number scores one point
(in case of a tie, no one scores). After all the rounds, the points are
counted and the player who has the greater score wins.

Og and his children really like this game, but they usually get lost doing the
math. Will you help Og to determine the final score?

## Input

The input consists of several test cases (matches). Each test case starts with
an integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10$) that describes the number of rounds of the
match. The value N = 0 indicates the end of the input, and should not be
processed. The next N lines contain two integers $A$ and $B$ each
($0 \leq A, B \leq 10$). A is the number yelled by the first player during the
round, and B is the number yelled by the second player during the round.

## Output

The output must contain one line for each test case. This line contains the
players' score, separated by a single space.
