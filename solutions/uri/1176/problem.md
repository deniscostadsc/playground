# Fibonacci Array

Write a program that reads a number and print the fibonacci number
corresponding to this read number. Remember that the first elements of the
Fibonacci series are 0 and 1 and each next term is the sum of the two
preceding it. All the Fibonacci numbers calculated in this program must fit in
a unsigned 64 bits number.

## Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T, indicating the number
of test cases. Each test case contains a single integer $N$
($0 \leq N \leq 60$), corresponding to the N-th term of the Fibonacci series.

## Output

For each test case in the input, print the message "Fib (N) = X", where X is
the N-th term of the Fibonacci series.
