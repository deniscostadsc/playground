# Perfect Number

A Perfect Number is a number that is exacly the sum of all of their divisors.
For example the number 6 is perfect, because 1+2+3 is equal to 6. Your task is
to write a program that read integer numbers and print a message informing if
these numbers are perfect or are not perfect.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. The first contains the number of test
cases $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100$). Each of the following N lines contain an
integer $X$ ($1 \leq X \leq 108$), that can be or not a perfect number.

## Output

For each test case output the message “X eh perfeito” (X is perfect) or “X nao
eh perfeito” (X isn't perfect) according with to above specification.
