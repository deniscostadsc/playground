# Fire Flowers

Nowadays a fire flower isn’t a thing considered estrange to many young people.
This is because a famous video game popularized this type of flower.
In this game the protagonist gained superpowers by touching a fire flower,
going to shoot small fireballs to defeat your enemies.

However, there was already talk about fire flowers long time ago. In Polish
mythology, fire flowers are flowers of great mystical power guarded by evil
spirits. She had this name because it was so bright that was impossible to
look at it directly. Who got such flower possessed the ability to read the
minds of other people, finding hidden treasures and repel all evil.

To get a fire flower, one person should look for it in a forest before midnight
on the eve of Kupaly Noc. Exactly at midnight, she flourished. To harvest it
would be necessary to draw a circle around her. It seems an easy task, however,
the evil spirits that guard the flower of all try to distract anyone trying to
pick the flower. If the person failed when trying to draw a circle around the
flower, would have his life sacrificed.

Given two circles, one designed by an ambitious fire flowers hunter and another
representing the area of the flower, your task is to determine if the hunter
dies or becomes rich with his conquest.

## Input

The input contains many instances and ends with end of file (EOF). Each instance
consists in a line with six integers: $R_1 (1 \leq R_1)$, $X_1(|X_1|)$,
$Y_1(|Y_1|)$, $R_2 (R_2 \leq 1000)$, $X_2(|X_2|)$, $Y_2 (Y_2 \leq 1000)$.

The circle drawn by the hunter has radius R1 and center ($X_1$; $Y_1$).
The circle that represents the flower area have radius R2 e center
($X_2$; $Y_2$).

## Output

For each test case we will have a line of output, containing “MORTO” (dead) or
“RICO” (rich) if the hunt can pick the flower.
