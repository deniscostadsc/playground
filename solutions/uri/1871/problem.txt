One day Prof. Humberto José Roberto made the following question: If the zero to
the left of a number has no value, why would other positions of a number?
Analyzing as follows, it asks for your help, to add two integer values, the
result is displayed according to his reasoning, that is, without the zeros. For
example, to add 15 + 5, the result would be 20, but with this new idea, the new
result would be 2, and to add 99 + 6, the result would be 105, but with this
new idea, the new result would be 15.

Write a program that, given two integers without the digit zero, some the same
and, if the result has a zero digit, which remove them before display.

Input

There will be several test cases. Each test case begins with two integers M and
N ( 1 ≤ M ≤ N ≤ 999 999 999 ).

The last test case is indicated when C = M = 0, and this case should not be
processed.

Output

For each test case, print the sum of the two values without Zeros.
