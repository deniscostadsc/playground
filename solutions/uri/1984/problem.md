# The Pronalância Puzzle

iNASA scientists have discovered a new exoplanet which is 1 billion light
years from earth. The name of this planet was named Pronalândia in honor of
the young scientists being formed in PRONATEC. But the most amazing is yet to
come. Observing the planet they were able to identify that the inhabitants of
Pronalândia were trying to communicate with a number. But the number who have
found is reversed and how they found many of them, they called you to be able
to automate this process. Thus, given a number, your task is to print the
invert number.

## Input

The file contains only a test line which is the number found
($0 < n < 9999999999$).

Note.: the read number is too high to store in a variable of type int, so you
will need to use the long type, for reading and printing in C, you should use
the %llu.

## Output

print read number inverted. Do not forget to print the end of line (\n) else
you will receved the Presentation Error message.
