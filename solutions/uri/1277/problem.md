# Short Attendance

The students at your university have lately picked up the annoying habit of
missing classes. To fix this problem your board has decided to only allow
students with 75% or higher attendance to sit for the exams.

From a list of students' names and their respective attendance records, print
out the list of students who did not attend to enough classes and will be
denied to sit for exams.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. The first input line will contain an
integer T indicating the number of test cases that follow.

Each test case is composed of three input lines:

- The first line of a test case will contain an integer $N$
  ($0 \leq N \leq 100$) indicating the number of students in the class.
- The second line will contain N student names separated by a single space
  character. All names will contain only uppercase or lowercase letters (‘A’-
  ‘Z’,‘a’-‘z’).
- The third line will contain N attendance records, corresponding to their
  respective students from the previous line. The attendance records will be
  separated by a single space character, and contain only ‘A’, ‘P’ and   ‘M’
  characters. A ‘P’ indicates that the student was present in a class,‘A’
  shows that he was absent (he did not attend) and ‘M’ shows that he was
  absent for a class but submitted a doctor's note then that class is not
  counted when calculating his attendance percentage. An attendance record
  will contain at least one ‘A’ or ‘P’ character.

## Output

For each test case print out the names of all the students who do not meet the
attendance requirements, separated by a single space character. Do not leave
trailing spaces in the end of each line.
