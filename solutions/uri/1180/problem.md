# Lowest Number and Position

Write a program that reads a number N. This N is the size of a array X[N].
Next, read each of the numbers of X, find the smallest element of this array
and its position within the array, printing this information.

## Input

The first line of input contains one integer $N$ ($1 < N < 1000$), indicating
the number of elements that should be read to an array X[N] of integer
numbers. The second row contains each of the N values, separated by a space.

## Output

The first line displays the message “Menor valor:” followed by a space and the
lowest number read in the input. The second line displays the message
“Posicao:” followed by a space and the array position in which the lowest
number is, remembering that the array starts at the zero position.
