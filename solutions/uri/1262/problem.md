# Multiple Reading

In many computer systems, multiple processes can read from the same resource
during the same clock cycle, but only a single process can write to the
resource during a clock cycle. Reads and writes cannot be mixed during the
same clock cycle. Given a history of the reads and writes that occurred during
a particular computation as a String trace, and an int procs representing the
number of processes used by the computation, calculate the minimum duration of
the computation in clock cycles. The trace represents each read as an 'R' and
each write as a 'W'.

For example, if trace is "RWWRRR" and procs is 3, then the minimum number of
clock cycles is 4: one for the first read, one each for the two writes, and
one for the last group of reads.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. Each test case is composed by two
lines. The first line has a string made out of 1 to 50 characters, where each
can be either 'R' or 'W'. The second line contains an integer $P$
($1 \leq P \leq 10$), which represents the number of processes as a direct
indicator of how many read operations can be performed simultaneously. The
input stream ends in EOF.

## Output

For each test case determine and print the minimum number of clock cycles
required to run the given trace. For further reference see the examples below.
