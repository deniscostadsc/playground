# Password

Mr. Amn√©sio had great difficulty in keeping passwords. To remind them, he
always wore numbers, and writing on pieces of paper, which also lost easily,
causing it needed to change the password every time this happened. Tired, he
thought in a more practical way: put on paper the next number of password,
then he always used the same account to remember the password based on the
number written on paper. But he also forgot the formula, therefore, asked you
to write a program that, given the number of the paper, enter the
corresponding password. Write a program that, given a number, enter their
password.

## Input

The entry will have many test cases. Each test case will have a number N,
representing the number written on paper ($1001 \leq N \leq 9999$). The entry
ends with the end of the file.

## Output

For each test case, print the corresponding password. In all cases, the
formula will be the same in the examples below.
