# Simple Base Conversion

In this problem you are asked to write a simple base conversion program.
You will be given a hexadecimal or decimal integer number as input. You
will have to output the corresponding decimal or hexadecimal number.
Hexadecimal numbers always starts with a `0x' and all other numbers are
to be considered as decimal numbers. There will be no invalid numbers
in the input.

## Input

The input file contains several lines of input. Each line contains a single
non-negative number, which may be a decimal or hexadecimal number as
explained in the problem statement. The decimal value of this number will
be equal or less than $2^{31}$. A line containing a negative decimal number
terminates input. This number should not be processed. Input numbers will
contain no space within them.

## ÃŸOutput

For each line of input (Except the last one) produce one line of output.
This line should contain the decimal or hexadecimal representation of the
corresponding hexadecimal or decimal number. Like the input, the
hexadecimal numbers in the output should be preceded by a "0x".
