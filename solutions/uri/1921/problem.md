# Guilherme and His Kites

Guilherme loves kites, kites of different colors, forms and sizes. He realized
that in order to kites become stable, and thus fly higher, they must have a
taut string connecting all pairs of non-neighboors tips.

Despite being a very creative and clever child, Guilherme doesnâ€™t know how to
determine the number of strings necessary to make a kite of n sides stable.
Could you help him?

## Input

The single line of the input contains an integer $3 \leq n \leq 10^5$, the
number of sides of the kite.

## Output

Print a single number, the number of strings that Guilherme needs to make a
kite of n sides stable.
