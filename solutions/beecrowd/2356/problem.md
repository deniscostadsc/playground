# Bacteria I

Dr. Henrique really loves your research with bacteria. He tried make an
antibiotic resistant bacteria, and when evaluate the DNA, he noticed
similarity of the bacteria that are more resistant than the others. All of
them have the same part of its genetic code (composed of proteins A, C, G, T).
Therefore, Dr. Henrique realized that part of code define if a bacteria is
resistant or not. So, Dr. Henrique ask you to make a program that evaluate if
a bacteria is resistant given its DNA and the part of genetic code that gives
antibiotic resistance.

## Input

Each test case have two strings, $D$ and $S$, each one in a line, and
represent the DNA of bacteria and the genetic code that gives antibiotic
resistance. $1 \leq |D|, |S| \leq 100$. The strings are composed by
characters: A, C, G, T.

## Output

Output one line for each test case, having the string "Resistente" (without
quote) if the bacteria have the genetic code required in its DNA, or the
string "Nao resistente" (without quote) otherwise.
