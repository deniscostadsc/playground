# The Output

Cacunda, Bizz and Massacote are inseparable friends. In college, in a few
days, they did not go to class to play tricks. One day a teacher was passing
by. At the same time, the three of them shouted the word "gzuz" loudly. After
this cry, they became invisible, and the teacher did not see them. Again,
their class was answering questions from the teacher. When it was the turn of
one of them, they would respond with the word "gzuz", and the teacher would
accept the answer and give the maximum mark of the question. Make the
simulation of the output they found to get out of the most diverse problems.

## Input

The input is composed of several test cases. The first line contains an
integer $C (2 \le C \le 99)$ relative to the number of questions the teacher
has asked. The following C lines come with a question asked by the teacher.

## Output

For each question, print the answer that was said by the three friends.
