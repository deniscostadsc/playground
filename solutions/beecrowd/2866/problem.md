# Cryptotext

Cesar is a detective who investigates a series of robberies that happen in his
city. Everywhere a crime happens, the person who committed such a crime leaves a
written message, consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters. Cesar was able
to find a pattern in these messages and now extracts hidden text from each
message and asks for his help in trying to find out who is committing such
crimes.

## Input

The input is composed of several test cases. The first line contains an integer
$C (2 \leq C \leq 99)$ relative to the number of test cases. In the following $C$
lines, there will be coded messages, all with the same pattern with respect to
the example below.

## Output

For each test case in your program, you must print the extracted text from the
original message.
