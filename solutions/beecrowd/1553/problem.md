# Frequent Asked Questions

Lots of sites in the internet have a page called “Frequent Asked Questions”
that, as the name itself says, contains the questions that the users make
frequently.

The URI portal is used to receive lots of questions from their users, so
Neilor decided that it would be a good idea to add a Frequent Asked Questions
page to the site. As Neilor is very busy these days, he asked you to help him
with this page.

Given the identifiers of the questions asked by the users, say the number of
questions that will be added to this new page of the site. A question is
considered “frequent” when it is asked at least $K$ times.

## Input

There will be several test cases. Each test case starts with two integers $N$
and $K (1 \leq N \leq 1000, 1 \leq K \leq 100)$, indicating the number of
asked questions, and the number of times a question must be asked to be
considered “frequent”, respectively.

Following there will be $N$ integers $P (1 \leq P \leq 100)$, each indicating
the number of a question asked.

The last test case is indicated when $N = K = 0$, which should not be
processed.

## Output

For each test case print one line, containing one integer, indicating the
number of questions that will be added to this new page of the site.
