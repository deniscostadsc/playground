# Pedrinho's Christmas

Pedrinho is a boy who loves family parties, especially Christmas, when he wins
gifts from his parents and grandparents. This year, his father promised him a
PS4, but only if Pedrinho could solve some challenges throughout the year, one
of them, writing a program that calculates how many days are left until
Christmas.

However, Pedrinho is only 9 years old and knows nothing about programming, but
he knows that you, his cousin, mess with "computer stuff" and thus, he asked
you to write the program for him. Not only that, but he promised to let you
play every weekend and for how long you would like to.

## Input

The input consists of several test cases. Each line contains the month and the
day of the year 2016 (leap year). Read input until EOF.

## Output

If it's Christmas, print "E natal!"; if it's Christmas Eve, print "E vespera
de natal!"; if it has already passed, print "Ja passou!". Otherwise, print
"Faltam X dias para o natal!", being X the number of days left until
Christmas.
