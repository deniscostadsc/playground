# Brazil World Cup

Brazil is the country hosting the world cup this year. However, there are many
people protesting against the government. In social networks you can see
people saying the world cup will not happen.

But these rumors that there will be no world cup are totally false, president
Dilma Rousseff has warned: the world cup will happen, and if someone complains
about it, we will host again!

## Input

The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of a line
containing a number N of complaints about the world cup forwarded to the
president ($0 \leq N \leq 100$).

## Output

For each test, the output consists of one line saying "vai ter copa!" if there
is no complaints for president. If there are complaints, the output should say
"vai ter duas!".
