# Small Unlucky Numbers

An unlucky number is one that contains a 1 followed by a 3 among its digits. For
example, the number 341329 is an unlucky number, while the number 26771 is not.

Given an integer $N$, your program will have to determine if $N$ is unlucky or
not.

## Input

The input consists of a positive integer $N (0 \leq N \leq 10^{17})$

## Output

Print the message "$N$ es de Mala Suerte" if $N$ is an unlucky number, otherwise
print "$N$ NO es de Mala Suerte".
