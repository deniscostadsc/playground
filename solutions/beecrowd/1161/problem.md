# Factorial Sum

Read two numbers M and N indefinitely. Calculate and write the sum of their
factorial. Be carefull, because the result can have more than 15 digits.

## Input

The input file contains many test cases. Each test case contains two integer
numbers $M (0 \leq M \leq 20)$ and $N (0 \leq N \leq 20)$. The end of file
is determined by eof.

## Output

For each test case in the input your program must print a single line,
containing an number that is the sum of the both factorial ($M$ and $N$).
