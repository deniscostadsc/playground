# Playing Darts by Distance

John and Mary created their own version of darts, darts by distance. Each one
throws 3 darts, choosing how far they will play from the target. In the normal
game of darts, a number x is scored by the distance between where the dart hit
and the center of the target. In the game of John and Mary it is punctuated xd
where d is the distance betwen the shooter and the target.

John asks you to make an algorithm that gives the score given the distance of
each turn, returns the winner
