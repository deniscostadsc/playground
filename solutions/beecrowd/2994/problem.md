# How much does a Doctor earn?

You work in the IT sector for a hospital and need to calculate the payment
revenue from each of the doctors. Each doctor earns 150$ per hour plus a
percentage that depends on the work shift. For example, the doctor Wellington
worked 1 hour in the day shift, and 2 hours in the night shift, therefore his
weekly salary will be: ( ( 1 * 150 ) + 1% ) + ( ( 2 * 150 ) + 15% ) = 496.5.
Furthermore, you can use the function ROUND(value,1) to show the salary with 1
decimal place e order the result from the highest to lowest salary.
