# Input and Output of Integers

Your teacher would like you to do a program with the following
characteristics:

1. Create three variables to store whole numbers;
1. Read the first number, which can be a value in the range of: $-10000 \leq A
   \leq 10000$;
1. Read the second number, which can be a value in the range of: $0 \leq B
   \leq 99$;
1. Read the third number, which can be a value in the range of: $0 \leq C \leq
   999$;
1. Print the letter A, a space, the equals sign, a blank, the number stored in
   the first variable, a comma, a blank, the letter B, a blank, the equal
   sign, a blank, the number stored in the second variable, a comma, a blank,
   the letter C, a blank, the equal sign, a blank, the number stored in the
   third variable. Do not forget to skip line;
1. Repeat procedure 5, putting the number in a 10-digit spacing and justified
   to the right;
1. Repeat procedure 5, putting the number in a 10-digit spacing and filled
   with zeros;
1. Repeat procedure 5 by placing the number in a 10-digit spacing and
   justified to the left.

## Input

The entry consists of several test files. Each test file has three rows. In
the first line has an integer $A (-10000 \leq A \leq 10000)$. In the second
line has an integer $B (0 \leq B \leq 99)$. In the third line has an integer
$C (0 \leq C \leq 999)$. As shown in the following input samples.

## Output

For each file in the entry, you have an output file. The output file has four
rows as described in item 5. As shown in the following output samples.
