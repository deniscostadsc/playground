# Square Array IV

Your work in this program is to read an integer number that is the size of a
square matrix (width and height) to be filled as follows: the outer part is
filled with 0 in the inner part is filled with 1, the main diagonal is filled
with 2, the secondary diagonal is filled with 3 and the central element is 4,
as the examples below.

Obs: square with '1' always starts at position size / 3, considering width and
height and both begin in 0 (zero).

## Input

The input contains a number of test cases and ends with EOF (end of file).
Each test case consists of an odd integer number $N (5 \leq N \leq 101)$ that is
the size of the array. For each test case, print the corresponding array as
below. After each test case, print a blank line.

## Output

For each test case, print the corresponding array as below. After each test
case, print a blank line.
