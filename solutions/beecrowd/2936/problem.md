# How Much Cassava?

Every year in April, the Curupira, Boitatá, the pink Boto (this one in his man
form, as Dona Chica likes it better), Mapinguari and Iara meet at Dona Chica
to remember their moments with Mani, the beautiful girl with the white skin.
And as it could not be different the main dish of this meeting is the cassava.
Each one of them eats one to ten servings of cassava and they always warn
Dona. Chica in advance about how many servings they will eat that day. The
size of the portion of each is different, but they are always the same. The
portions are as follows (in grams):

- Curupira eats 300
- Boitatá eats 1500
- Boto eats 600
- Mapinguari eats 1000
- Iara eats 150

Dona chica in turn always eats 225 grams of cassava. Tired of every year
having to figure out how much cassava to prepare she contacted you to write a
program that tells how much cassava should be prepared in grams.

## Input

The input consists of 5 integers each representing the portions that the
guests of Dona Chica will consume. The first integer represents the portions
of Curupira, the second of Boitatá, the third of Boto, the fourth of
Mapinguari and the fifth of Iara.

## Output

The output consists of a single integer representing how much cassava Dona
Chica should prepare in grams. Do not forget the line break after the awnser
:).
