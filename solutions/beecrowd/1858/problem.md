# Theon's Answer

Ramsay: "(...) you win the game if you figure out who I am and why I'm
torturing you."

Theon must think quickly and guess who his torturer is! However, Ramsey
already decided what he will do after Theon gives his answer.

There are N people Theon may say the torturer is. Let us consider that the
people are numbered from 1 to N. If Theon answers the torturer is person i,
Ramsay will hit him Ti times.

You task is to help Theon and determine what he should answer in order to
minimize the number of times he will be hit.

## Input

The first line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100$). The second line
contains $N$ integers $T1, T2, ..., TN$ ($0 \leq Ti \leq 20$).

## Output

Print a single line containing the number of the person Theon must say the
torturer is. If there is more than one possible answer, print the smallest
one.
