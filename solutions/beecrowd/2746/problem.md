# Viruses

Viruses are evolving, but new research has proven that by switching some
proteins the vaccine becomes unbeatable. The protein H1(Hemagglutinin) when
replaced by the X protein (Xenomorphina) has interesting effects against
almost every viral disease. Some conspiracists say that after the vaccine’s
discovery some strange 3 meters tall creatures were found in the surroundings
of the laboratories, but this is clearly a lie.

Therefore, you must replace every string “H1”( Hemagglutinin ) by 'X' (
Xenomorphina ).
