# Score Validation

Write a program that reads two scores of a student. Calculate and print the
average of these scores. Your program must accept only valid scores
(between 0.0 and 10.0). Each score must be validated separately.

## Input

The input file contains many floating-point numbers​​, positive or negative.
The program execution will be finished after the input of two valid scores.

## Output

When an invalid score is read, you should print the message "nota invalida".
After the input of two valid scores, the message "media = " must be printed
followed by the average of the student. The average must be printed with 2
numbers after the decimal point.
