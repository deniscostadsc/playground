# Flowers Flourish from France

Fiona has always loved poetry, and recently she discovered a fascinating
poetical form. Tautograms are a special case of alliteration, which is the
occurrence of the same letter at the beginning of adjacent words. In
particular, a sentence is a tautogram if all of its words start with the same
letter.

For instance, the following sentences are tautograms:

- Flowers Flourish from France
- Sam Simmonds speaks softly
- Peter pIckEd pePPers
- truly tautograms triumph

Fiona wants to dazzle her boyfriend with a romantic letter full of this kind
of sentences. Please help Fiona to check if each sentence she wrote down is a
tautogram or not.

## Input

Each test case is given in a single line that contains a sentence. A sentence
consists of a sequence of at most 50 words separated by single spaces. A word
is a sequence of at most 20 contiguous uppercase and lowercase letters from
the English alphabet. A word contains at least one letter and a sentence
contains at least one word.

The last test case is followed by a line containing only a single character
'*' (asterisk).

## Output

For each test case output a single line containing an uppercase 'Y' if
the sentence is a tautogram, or an uppercase 'N' otherwise.
