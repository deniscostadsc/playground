# Students Grades

The semester is over at South Transylvania University. Every grade was closed,
and only Alchemy 104 havenâ€™t published its list of approved students.

Therefore, you should show the word '**Approved:** ' alongisde the the name of a
student and the grade, for those who have been approved $(grade \geq 7)$.

Remember to sort the list by grade (higher grades first).
