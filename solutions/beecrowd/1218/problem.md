# Getline Three - Shoes

Now that Mangojata solved some problems using getline, she is able to take a
step forward. She is about to make a new program to help her sister,
Overlaine. Overlaine is a seller of shoes and by a neglect, mixed all shoes of
each box. Now she wants to inform any number N and count how many shoes of
this size (N) exists inside a specific box. The problem is that Overlaine have
no any idea how many shoes are in each box. The only thing we know is that
each footwear may be numbered $20$-$44$, and may be male or female.

## Input

The input contains several test cases and ends with EOF (End of File). Each
test case is composed by two lines. The first line contains a number $N (20
\leq N \leq 44)$ of a shoe informed by Oveline. The second line contains the
number of each pair that are inside the box, followed by M or F, indicating if
this shoes are Masculine or Feminine.

## Output

For each test case print four lines, like given example. In the first line you
must print the message “Caso n:”, where n is the number of the test case. In
the second line you must print the message “Pares Iguais:” followed by how
many pairs of shoes have the same size of that wich Overlaine wants to find.
Follow two lines with the respective among of Feminine (F) and Masculine (M)
shoes, with corresponding message.

Print a blank line between the outputs for two consecutive test cases.
