# Feedback

Several students from various universities know the programming portal IRU.
This portal has thousands of programming problems available. Daily, the IRU
team receives several feedback (compliments, bugs, questions, suggestions,
...) that must first be assigned to team members answer.

As the team is very busy and have no time to sort these feedbacks, you were
asked to write a program to do that and show who will be responsible for
resolving and responding the feedback.

The team members responsible for each sector are:

1. Compliments: Rolien
1. Bugs: Naej
1. Questions: Elehcim
1. Suggestions: Odranoel

## Input

The first value is the number of test cases $N (1 \lt N \lt 100)$. Each test
case represent a day of work responding feedbacks. Each test case starts with
$K (1 \lt K \lt 50)$, indicating the number of feedbacks received on that
date. Then follows K lines with and integer representing the category of each
of the feedbacks as shown above (1, 2, 3 or 4).

## Output

For each test case you must print the name of the team member responsible for
the feedback.
