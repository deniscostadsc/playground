# Ones

Given any integer $n (1 \leq n \leq 10000)$ not divisible by 2 or 5, some
multiple of n is a number which in decimal notation is a sequence of 1\'s. How
many digits are in the smallest such a multiple of n?

## Input

The input consists in many test cases and ends with EOF. Each test case contains
one integer $n (1 \leq n \leq 10000)$ not divisible by 2 or 5.

## Output

For each test case, print how many digits have the multiple of n that attends
the above requisites.
