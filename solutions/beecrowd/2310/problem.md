# Volleyball

A volleyball coach would like to keep statistics about his team. In every game
he keeps track of the number of services, blocks and attacks of each player,
as well as how many of these services, blocks and attacks were successful
(scored points). Your program must show, with two decimal points what is the
total percentage of services, blocks and attacks by the whole team that were
successful.

## Input

Input starts with the number of players $N (1 \leq N \leq 100)$, followed by
the names of each of these players. Below the name of each player, two rows of
integers are presented. In the first row, the numbers represent the service,
blocks and attack attempts $(0 \leq S,B,A \leq 10000)$ by the specific player.
In the second row there is the number of these services, blocks and attacks
$(0 \leq S1 \leq S; 0 \leq B1 \leq B; 0 \leq A1 \leq A)$ that were successful.

## Output

The output must contain the total percentage of successful services, blocks
and attacks by the whole team, with two digits after the decimal point, as
shown in the example.
