# Fit or Dont Fit I

Paulinho have in your hands a little problem. The teacher asked him to make a
program to verify from two integer numbers A and B, if B corresponds to the
last digit of A.

## Input

The input consists of several test cases. The first line of input contains an
integer N that indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of
two integers $A (1 \leq A \lt 2^{31})$ e $B (1 \leq B \lt 2^{31})$ positives.

## Output

For each test case, print a message informing if the second number fit
("encaixa" in portuguese) or didn't fit ("nao encaixa") in the first number.
