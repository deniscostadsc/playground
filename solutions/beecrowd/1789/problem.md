# The Race of Slugs

The slugs racing is a sport that has grown in recent years, causing several
people dedicate their lives trying to capture fast slugs, and trains them to
make millions in races around the world. But the task of capturing fast slugs
is not an easy task, since almost all the slugs are very slow. Each slug is
classified at a level depending on their speed:

Level 1: If speed is less than 10 cm/h. Level 2: If speed is greater than or
equal to 10 cm/h and lower than 20 cm/h. Level 3: If speed is greater than or
equal to 20 cm/h.

Your task is to identify which level of speed faster slug of a group of slugs.

## Input

The entry consists consists multiple test cases, and each consists of two
lines: The first line contains an integer $L (1 \leq L \leq 500)$ representing
the number of slugs of the group, and the second line contains $L$ integers
$V_i (1 \leq Vi \leq 50)$ representing the speeds of each slug.

The input ends with end of file (EOF).

## Output

For each test case, output a single line with the level of speed faster slug
of a group of slugs.
