# Square Matrix III

Write a program that read an integer number $N (0 \leq N \leq 15)$ that
correspont to the order of a bidimentional array of integers, and build the
array according to the above example.

## Input

The input consists of several integers numbers, one per line, corresponding to
orders from arrays to be built. The end of input is indicated by zero (0).

## Output

For each integer number of input, print the corresponding array according to
the example. The values of the array must be formatted in a field of size T
right justified and separated by a space, where T is equal to the number of
digits of the biggest number in the array. None space must be printed after
the last character of each row of the array. A blank line must be printed
after each array.
