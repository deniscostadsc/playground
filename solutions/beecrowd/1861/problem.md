# Hall of Murderers

Who killed Meryn Trant? Who killed Syrio Forel, in the case wherein he is
actually dead? Who killed Stannis Baratheon? Who killed Myrcella Baratheon? Who
killed Aerys II Targaryen? Who is going to kill (**spoiler alert!**) Jaime
Lannister? For some of these questions we had the answer already. For others, we
had just speculations. However, we have received from an anonymous correspondent
a list describing many murders, which have already happened or are still to
happen, revealing the name of the murderers as of the murdered ones. But the
murders are not in lexicographical order, not even in chronological order, and
it becomes hard to count how many people each murderer has killed. Can you help
us?

## Input

Each line of input describes a murder by informing the murderer's name followed
by the name of the one who has been killed. Each name consists of at least one
and at most 10 characters, with the first being always in capital case and the
others always in small case. The input consists of at least one and at most
$10^5$ lines and is ended in end-of-file.

## Output

The first line of output shall be consisted of the sentence “HALL OF MURDERERS”,
without the quotation marks. Each one of the following lines shall contain a
name of a murderer followed by the number of people that he or she has killed.
The list of murderers shall follow the lexicographical ordering. If a murderer
has also ended up being killed, he or she shall not appear in the list.
