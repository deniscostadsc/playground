# Converting to Hexadecimal

Data stored in computers are in binary. An economic way of visualizing these
numbers is the usage of base 16 (hexadecimal).

Your task is to write a program that, given a natural number at base 10, shows
its representation in hexadecimal.

## Input

The input is a positive integer number $V$ at base 10
$(1 \leq V \leq 2 \times 10^9)$.

## Output

The output is the same number $V$ at base 16 in a single line (don't forget
the end-of-line character). Use uppercase letters, as shown in the examples.
