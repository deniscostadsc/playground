# Christmas Tree

Children do love draw christmas trees and you challenged some of them to draw
trees of many sizes just with the asterisk "*" char.

The rule is simple: from bottom to top, the trunk of the tree consists of one
line with three asterisks and one line with one asterisk. Then comes the rest
of the tree, with each row starting with the size ordered by you and
decreasing every two caracter, until you reach the top of the tree that have
just one asterisk. Note that for this to work, will only be allowed odd sizes
to the trees.

## Input

The input contains many test cases and ends with EOF. Each test case consist
of an integer number $N (2 \leq N \leq 100)$.

## Output

For each test case, print a tree as specified above and as the example below,
with a blank line after each tree.
