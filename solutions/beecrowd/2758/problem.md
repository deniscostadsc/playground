# Floating Number Input and Output

Your teacher would like to make a program with the following characteristics:

1. Create two variables to store real numbers of simple precision;
1. Create two variables to store double precision real numbers;
1. Read the first simple precision number that will always have a decimal;
1. Read the second simple precision number that will always have two decimal
   places;
1. Read the first double precision number that will always have three decimal
   places;
1. Read the second double precision number that will always have four decimal
   places;
1. Print the letter $A$, a blank, the equals sign, a blank, the number stored in
   the first variable read in step 3, a comma, a blank, the letter $B$, a blank,
   the sign of equal, a space, the number stored in the second variable read in
   step 4. Do not forget to skip line;
1. Print the letter $C$, a blank, the equal sign, a blank, the number stored in
   the first variable read in step 5, a comma, a blank, the letter $D$, a blank,
   the sign of equal, a space, the number stored in the second variable read in
   step 6. Do not forget to skip line;
1. Repeat procedure 7, printing the numbers with one decimal place;
1. Repeat procedure 8, printing the numbers with one decimal place;
1. Repeat procedure 7, printing the numbers to two decimal places;
1. Repeat procedure 8, printing the numbers to two decimal places;
1. Repeat procedure 7, printing the numbers to three decimal places;
1. Repeat procedure 8, printing the numbers to three decimal places;
1. Repeat procedure 7, printing the numbers to three decimal places and in the
   form of scientific notation with the character E;
1. Repeat procedure 8, printing the numbers to three decimal places and in the
   form of scientific notation with the character E;
1. Repeat procedure 7, printing only the whole part of the number;
1. Repeat procedure 8, printing only the entire part of the number.

## Input

The input consists of several test files. Each test file has two rows. In the
first line there are two real numbers $A$ and $B (-1000.0 \leq A, B \leq
1000.0)$, separated by white space. In the second line there are two real
numbers $C$ and $D (-1000.0 \leq C, D \leq 1000.0)$, separated by white space.
As shown in the following input example.

## Output

For each file in the input, you have an output file. The output file has twelve
rows as described in item 7 and 8. As shown in the following output example.
