# Long Live Science!

Oronob is a very peculiar boy. For him, only his opinion matters and nothing
more. During the Coronga Virus pandemic, he uses his opinion to retaliate what
science says. He then, to boost his opinions, created a bot (robot that
generates automatic messages) to trigger his texts to many people.

You know Oronob, but unlike him, you are sensible and you know that science is
not refuted with opinion, as well as understanding programming, so you decided
to hack Oronob's bot to avoid its fallacies.

Well, then create an algorithm that changes the text of Oronob's opinions to the
real truth.

## Input

An S text with alphanumeric characters and possible spaces between words.

Limits: 0 <| S | <= 280.;)

## Output

The truth.
