# Rest 1.0

John is a math student, but few people know that. One day, one of his
classmates, thinking that John did not know basic math concepts, challenged
him to perform a simple calculation which was: Calculate the rest of the
division of $A \div B$.

Since John is very shy and you are best friends, he informed you what the
answer to the problem was and asked you to pass this information on to this
colleague who challenged him. You can do it?

Given two integers $A$ and $B$, tell what is the rest of division of $A \div
B$ John passed you.

## Input

The input contains two integers $A$ and $B (1 \leq A, B \leq 100000)$.

## Output

The output contains one unique integer that is the rest of division of $A \div
B$.
