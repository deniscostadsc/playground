# Cards

Beatriz loves to play cards with her friends. To train memory and logical
thinking, she invented a small hobby with cards. She removes the top five
cards from the top of a well-shuffled deck, and places them in sequence from
left to right, the table with the face down.

Then she looks, for a moment, each of the sequence of cards (and soon puts
back on the table, face down). Using only your memory, Beatrice should now say
whether the sequence of cards is increasingly ordered, decreasingly, or is not
orderly.

After so much play, she's getting tired, and do not trust their own judgment
to find out whether she has succeeded or made a mistake. So she asked you to
make a program that, given a sequence of five cards, determine whether a given
sequence is ordered increasingly, decreasingly, or is not orderly.

## Input

The input consists of a single line containing five cards of the sequence.
Card values are represented by integers between 1 and 13. The five cards have
different values.

## Output

Your program should produce a single line containing a single uppercase
character 'C' if the given sequence is increasingly ordered, 'D' if ordered
decreasingly, or 'N' otherwise.
