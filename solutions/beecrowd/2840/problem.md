# Balloon++

I hope you are enjoying the competition

We the authors (Diego Rangel, Francisco Arcos, Gabriel Duarte and Gustavo
Policarpo), we are happy to be trying to solve our problems. For you who are
beginner and do not leave the room without any balloon here is a challenge for
you:

- This year the balloons have a spherical shape, according to the company that
  produces the balloons: "... for complex engineering reasons, this format is
  better (...)" will understand ...
- However this format makes the balloon use more helium gas and this caused a
  problem because the organizer had already bought a tank with L liters of gas
  before this novelty in the balloon market.

Knowing the radius of the balloon model and the amount of helium gas available,
could you help the team by saying how many balloons can be filled completely?

## Input

The input is composed of two integers $R$ and $L (1 \leq R, L \leq 10^9)$ the
radius and the amount of gas available respectively.

Consider PI = 3.1415

## Output

You must print a single integer representing the amount of balloons that can be
filled with the amount of helium gas available.
