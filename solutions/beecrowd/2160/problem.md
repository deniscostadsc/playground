# Name at Form

Filling forms is a simple task. But it is necessary to check if the reserved
space for data is large enough.

Your task is, given a text line, to indicate if it fits in an 80 characters
length form.

## Input

Input is a text line $L (1 \leq |L| \leq 500)$.

## Output

The output is given in a single line. It must be "YES" (without quotes) if the
text line L is up to 80 characters long. If L has more than 80 characters, the
output must be "NO".
