# Friends of Habay

Every end of year there is a party in Fantastic Education Institution (FEI).
Early in July, the registration is open to take part in it. At registration, the
user can choose whether to be "O Amigo do Habay" (The Friend of Habay) in the
party or not. The most logical choice would be Yes, because it is a privilege to
be The Friend of Habay, since he is the coolest person in FEI. However, there
are some people who definitely don't want to be The Friend of Habay, and for
unknown reasons.

Only one will be chosen. As a result, many students who chose the option Yes
registered several times to increase their chance of being The Friend of Habay.
The party organizer hired you to organize the website's registration, since
there is a registration spam going on. The criteria to be the chosen one is the
number of letters of the first name, and if there is more than one name with the
same number of letters, wins the one who first registered. The final
organization of the registered users should follow the order of choice (Yes or
No), while respecting the alphabetical order.

Note: No one who chose the option No registered more than once.

## Input

The input consists of a single test case. Each line consists of the user's first
name (no spaces), followed by the option YES (if the user wants to be O Amigo do
Habay, i.e., The Friend of Habay) or NO (if the user doesn't). Read input until
the user enters "FIM" (without quotes).


## Output

Print the registered users in order of choice, respecting the alphabetical
order, then print the winner's name. Print a blank line between the list of
registered users and the winner's name.
