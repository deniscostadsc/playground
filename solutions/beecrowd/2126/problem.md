# Searching Subsequences

Given two natural numbers $N_1$ and $N_2$, it is said that $N_1$ is contiguous
subsequence of $N_2$ if in $N_1$ appear all digits in the same order and
contiguously. Create an program that reads two natural numbers and write if
the first is a contiguous subsequence of the second.

## Input

The input consists of several test cases and ends with the end of file (EOF).
The first line of each entry is composed of anatural value $N_1 (1 < N_1
<10^{10})$, the second line is composed of a value $N_2 (N_1 < N_2 <
10^{32})$.

## Output

For each test case print the amount of contiguous subsequences and the
position where the substring starts, if there is more of a subsequence, print
where it started the last substring. If no there subsequence, print "Nao
existe subsequencia" (that means no there subsequence). Show the result as the
sample output.
