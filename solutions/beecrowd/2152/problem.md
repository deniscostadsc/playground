# Pepe, I Already Took the Candle!

One day, the great hero Chapolout helped a scientist who has created many
inventions. One of these inventions is a system that opens the door secret
laboratory. The system consists of removing a side door of the candlestick
candle, that it opens, and to put the candle back to the chandelier, the door
closes. But Chapolout found that the sail was just a pretend. In fact, the
scientist assistant, called Pepe, that opened the lab door, inside. A while
later, the system was modified to also run the initial project. A pressure
sensor placed below the chandelier candle, so that the removal of the active
sail system. This system issues a log report for every time the door opened or
closed, but the log is quite confusing. Every record, three whole numbers are
registered, and the hour and the minute the event occurred and a value that
represents the door opened or closed at the time. Pepe asks for your help to
convert the log data more readable data to it.

Write a program that, given a log record, this is converted into more readable
texts.

## Input

The first line contains the number of test cases. Each line of a test case has
three integers H, M and O, the time being, the minutes of the occurrence, and
the instance itself (zero if the door closed or the door opened).

## Output

For each test case, print the time of the occurrence, in due form, followed by
a space, a hyphen and a space, and the phrase "A porta abriu!" or "A porta
fechou!" as the occurrence recorded.
