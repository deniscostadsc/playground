# The Christmas Tree

Every year, Roberto likes to choose his Christmas tree, he doesn't let anyone
choose for him, because he thinks the tree to be beautiful, must meet some
conditions, such as height, thickness and number of branches, so he can hang
many Christmas decorations on it.

Roberto wants his tree to be at least 200 centimeters tall, but he doesn't want
it to be larger than 300 centimeters, or the tree won't fit in his house. As for
thickness, he wants his tree to have a trunk that is 50 centimeters in diameter
or more. The tree must be 150 branches or greater.

## Input

The first line of input contains an integer $N (0 \lt N \leq 10000)$, the number
of test cases. The next $N$ lines contain 3 integers each, $h$, $d$ and $g (0
\lt a, d, g \leq 5000)$, the height of the tree in centimeters, its diameter in
centimeters, and the amount of tree branches.

## Output

Your task is, for each tree, to print Sim, if it is a tree that Roberto can
choose, or Nao, if it is a tree he should not choose.
