# Album of the Cup

In Soccer World Cup year, the official album of cards is always a great success
among children and also among adults. For those who do not know, the album
contains spaces numbered from 1 to N to paste the cards; each sticker, also
numbered from 1 to N, is a small photo of a player from one of the selections
that will play the World Cup. The goal is to paste all the cards in the
respective spaces in the album, in order to complete the album (that is, leave
no space without the corresponding sticker).

The cards are sold in sealed envelopes, so the buyer does not know which cards
he is buying, and it may happen that he has bought a card he has already pasted
on the album.

To help users, the company that sells the album and stickers wants to create an
application that allows them to easily manage the missing pieces to complete the
album and is asking for their help.

Given the total number of spaces and stickers in the album, and a list of
already purchased cards (which may contain repeated cards), your task is to
determine how many cards are missing to complete the album.

## Input

The first line contains an integer $(1 \leq N \leq 100)$, on total stickers and
spaces in the album. The second line contains an integer $M (1 \leq M \leq 300)$
from the number of stickers already purchased. Each of the MÃºrias closed the
entire $X (1 \leq X \leq N)$, indicating a card already bought.
## Output

Your program should produce a single line containing an integer representing the
number of missing cards to complete the album.
