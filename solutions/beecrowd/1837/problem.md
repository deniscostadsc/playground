# Preface

It has begun the IV UFFS Programming Contest! We hope you enjoy the next hours
you are going to spend with us, as we hope you have a lot of fun! Good luck!

This is the 3rd year of the Programming Club, an extension program whose
primary goal is to help the programmers of the Brazilian region known as
Southern Border to get readier to face the computational challenges from both
academic and corporate worlds. Our main strategy lies in promoting workshops
and training sessions for Programming contests, not only for students of our
institution (UFFS), but also for whoever wants to participate. Despite of many
issues, we find ourselves very happy with the results we have been achieving.
Having other institutions as partners, as UNOCHAPECÓ, URI and UNOESC, we
collaborated to make Chapecó in the past two years the 2nd largest site of
ICPC Brazilian Subregional Contest, which is another indicator of the
enthusiasm our people has in Programming.

In order to warm you up for this particular contest, we shall ask you to write
a program which calculates the quotient and the remainder of the division of
two integers, can that be? Recall that the quotient and the remainder of the
division of an integer a by a non-zero integer b are respectively the only
integers q and r such that $0 \leq r < |b|$ and:

$a = b \times q + r$

In case you don't know it, the theorem that guarantees the existence and the
uniqueness of the integers q and r is known as ‘Euclidean Division Theorem’ or
‘Division Algorithm’.

## Input

The input consists of two integers $a$ and $b$ ($-1000 \leq a, b < 1000$).

## Output

Print the quotient q followed by the remainder r of the division of a by b.
