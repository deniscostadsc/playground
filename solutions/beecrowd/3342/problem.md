Keanu was testing new chessboard models when he had the following doubt:

<center><img src="imgs/e5edbc4221a7680ac115b6fe74363bf9c706cf9e.png"></center>
<center>5 white squares and 4 black squares</center>

<center>8 white squares and 8 black squares</center>

Note that the topmost and leftmost square is always white.
