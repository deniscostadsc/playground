# Middle Nephew

Uncle Patinhas was a millionaire who lived in his mansion, and he had three
nephews: Huguinho, Zezinho and Luisinho. He was easily confused between the
three nephews because they were very similar, despite their different ages. One
day, the three made a bet with their uncle: if he guessed who the middle nephew
was, that is, neither the youngest nor the oldest, they would give him a gold
coin, and if he missed, he would have to give each one a gold coin. So the uncle
asks for your help so he can win this bet

## Input

Input consists of several test cases. Each case contains three integer values
$H$, $Z$ and $L$, which represent the ages of Huguinho, Zezinho and Luisinho,
respectively.

## Output

For each test case print the name of the middle nephew in lowercase.
