# Our Days Are Never Coming Back

So, have you liked the Winter School this year? In order to make this School
happen, many have worked, whether in writing the problems, in configuring the
Portal, in making the arrengements for the event or in raising the funds. Our
special acknowledgement this year goes to Professor Ricardo Oliveira, who has
not only accepted our invitation to come and teach the workshops but has also
been participating on the organisation of this School. We are sure that his
experience and his career at ICPC as contestant and as coach have motived and
inspired us all.

We hope you have enjoyed these last days in Essos and in Westeros, we hope you
have learned a lot and had fun. But it is not only in Essos and in Westeros
that you should have fun. Here, in Beyond the Wall, programming is also fun.
Keep studying, keep training, and more and more. What is important is the path
you choose to pursue from now on. Our advice is that you should always enjoy
every single moment, every workshop, every school, every training session,
every time practicing or studying at home. Our days are never coming back.

## Input

The input consists of a single integer $N (1 \leq N \leq 34)$ in a line.

## Output

Print the N first characters of Søren Kierkegaard's quote defined by the
letters underlined in this problem statement. Be careful, for no blank space
has been underlined — you are supposed to guess the number and the location of
the blank spaces at the sentence. The only line of output shall consist only
of capital letters and blank spaces, and shall be ended by end-of-line.
