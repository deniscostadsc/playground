## Input

The input contains many test cases. The first line of standard input contains
an integer $C$, the number of test cases. $C$ data sets follow. Each data set
begins with an integer, $N$, the number of people in the class
($1 \leq N \leq 1000$). $N$ integers follow, separated by spaces or newlines,
each giving the final grade (an integer between 0 and 100) of a student in the
class.

## Output

For each case you are to output a line giving the percentage of students
whose grade is above average, rounded to 3 decimal places.
