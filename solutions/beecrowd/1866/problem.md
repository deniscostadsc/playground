whoever hit him more , would not pay the bill. Then the following is proposed:
Given the following sum below report the result , with the same number of
terms: S = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1... Write a program that , given a
number of terms, report the result of the sum above.

## Input

An integer C shall be informed , which is the amount of test cases. Each test
case starts with an integer $N (1 \leq N \leq 1000)$, indicating the number
of terms of the sum.

## Output

For each test case print a number S , which is the sum of N terms of
expression.
