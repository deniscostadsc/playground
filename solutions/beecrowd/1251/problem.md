# Tell me the Frequencies!

Given a line of text you will have to find out the frequencies of the ASCII
characters present in it. The given lines will contain none of the first 32 or
last 128 ASCII characters. Of course lines may end with ‘\n’ and ‘\r’ but
always keep those out of consideration.

## Input

Several lines of text are given as input. Each line of text is considered as a
single input. Maximum length of each line is 1000 characters.

## Output

Print the ASCII value of the ASCII characters which are present and their
frequency according to the given format below. A blank line should separate
each set of output. Print the ASCII characters in the ascending order of their
frequencies. If two characters are present the same time print the information
of the ASCII character with higher ASCII value first. Input is terminated by
end of file.
