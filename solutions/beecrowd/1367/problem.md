# Help!

Well, we have to admit: we need your help. This year things have not been
running as smoothly as we wished, and we could not finish the contest system
software in time. One vital part is missing, and as you know, we need the
system working by this afternoon, for the real contest. The missing part is
the module that computes the team’s scores, given the team’s list of
submissions. Please, please, someone help us!

## Input

The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains
a single integer $N$ indicating the number of submissions in the test
$(1 \leq N \leq 300)$. Each of the following N lines describe a submission;
each of these lines contains a problem identifier (a single letter from ’A’ to
’Z’), followed by an integer $T$ representing the time in minutes
$(0 \leq T \leq 300)$, followed by a judgement (the word “correct” or the word
“incorrect”). The input is in ascending order by time, and there will be at
most one“correct”judgement for each problem. The end of input is indicated by
$N = 0$. The input must be read from standard input.

## Output

For each test case in the input your program should output a line containing
two integers S and P , separated by a space, where S is the number of distinct
problems with a “correct” judgement and P is the time at which each distinct
problem is first judged “correct”, plus 20 for each “incorrect” submission for
a problem that is later judged “correct”. The output must be written to
standard output.
