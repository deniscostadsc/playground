# Chocolate Factory

One factory produces chocolate bars in cubes and parallelepipeds with the same
volume. However, since the machine that produces chocolate cubes has been
showing some problems, the owners asked you for help to fix this problems.

Your task is, given the size of the edges of the parallelepipeds chocolate,
inform the size the edge of the cube form should have.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains
three integers $A$, $B$ and $C$ $(1 \leq A, B, C \leq 10^3)$, indicating the
size of the edges of the parallelepiped. The input ends when $A = B = C = 0$,
and should not be processed.

## Output

For each input, you must print an integer that should be truncated, representing
the size that the edge in cube form should have.
