Andy, 8, has a dream - he wants to produce his very own dictionary. This is not
an easy task for him, as the number of words that he knows is, well, not quite
enough. Instead of thinking up all the words himself, he has a briliant idea.
From his bookshelf he would pick one of his favourite story books, from which he
would copy out all the distinct words. By arranging the words in alphabetical
order, he is done! Of course, it is a really time-consuming job, and this is
where a computer program is helpful.

<p>
You are asked to write a program that lists all the different words in the input
text. In this problem, a word is defined as a consecutive sequence of alphabets,
in upper and/or lower case. Words with only one letter are also to be
considered. Furthermore, your program must be CaSe InSeNsItIvE. For example,
words like "Apple", "apple" or "APPLE" must be considered the same.
