# Santa's Translator

Nicholas is already pretty tired and his memory is not the same. You, as his
navigator, should help Santa to shout the phrase "Merry Christmas" in the
correct language according to each country.

As you are a very smart elf, you have already created a small app on your
mobile (yes, elves have cell phones) that will let you know the phrase in the
correct language according to the name of the country. The sled is modern (it
was upgraded in 2000), thus it displays the name of the current country in the
navigation panel.

The data you included in your app was:

```
brasil              Feliz Natal!
alemanha            Frohliche Weihnachten!
austria             Frohe Weihnacht!
coreia              Chuk Sung Tan!

```

To avoid the risk of informing the wrong sentence to Santa you decided to test
your application a few more times.

## Input

You will test your application with different names of countries, simulating
the data reported by the navigation pane present on the sleigh.

## Output

Your application should display on the screen the words in the correct
language. If it is not registered, you should display the message "--- NOT
FOUND ---" so that after the tests you can complete the database.
