# Shopping List

Valentina is a very dedicated woman and she works late every day. To save her
time, she writes down the items at the same time she remembers. She uses a
mobile app for this task.

The problem is that the application does not delete duplicate items and as
Valentina is distracted, she frequently notes the same item more than once and
the list gets too long. You should improve the app used by Valentina. Make a
code that excludes duplicate items from the shopping list and sorts them in
alphabetical order.

## Input

The first input line contains an integer N (N < 100) that indicates the number
of test cases that follows. Each shopping list consists of a single line that
contains from 1 to 1000 items or words composed only of lowercase letters (from
one up to 20 chars), without accents and separated by a space.

## Output

The output consist of N lines, each representing one of Valentina's shopping
lists, with no items repeated and sorted in alphabetical order.
