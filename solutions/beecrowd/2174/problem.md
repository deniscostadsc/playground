# Pomekon Collection

Since it was officially released Pomekon in Brazil, Dabriel is trying to
realize his biggest dream: Being a Master Pomekon. His goal is to conquer the
151 Pomekons available. He managed to capture many monsters, but in his city
appear many repeated Pomekons, causing he to capture several times the same
Pomekon.

Seeing that his bag is pretty full, Dabriel asked you to do a computer program
to inform him how many Pomekons are missing to complete the collection.

## Input

The first line of the test case consists of an integer $N (1 \leq N \leq
10^3)$, representing the amount of Pomekons that Dabriel already captured.

The next $N$ lines consists of a string $S (1 \leq |S| \leq 10^3)$
representing the name of each Pomekon. The name of each Pomekon consists only
of uppercase and lowercase letters.

## Output

You should print: "Falta(m) X pomekon(s).", where X is the amount Pomekons not
captured.
