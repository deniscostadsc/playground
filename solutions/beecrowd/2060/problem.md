# Bino's Challenge

Bino and Cino are close friends. Bino likes to create mathematical challenges
to Cino. This time, Bino created a list of numbers and asked to Cino: How many
numbers are multiples of 2, 3, 4 and 5?

This challenge looks simple, but when the list contains many numbers, Cino
makes some miscalculations. To help Cino, make a program to solve the Bino's
Challenge.

## Input

The first line of input consists of an integer $N (1 \leq N \leq 1000)$,
representing the amount of numbers in the Bino's list.

The second line contains N integers $L_i (1 \leq L_i \leq 100)$, representing
the numbers of the Bino's list.

## Output

Print the amount of multiples of 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the list. Note the
formatting of the output in the output sample, because it must be followed
strictly. "Multiplo(s)" means "Multiple(s)" in English, but you must print the
message in Portuguese.
