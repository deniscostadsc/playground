# Medal Table

Somebody messed up the olympic medal table. Your program must put it back in the
right order. The order of the countries in the medal table is given by the
number of gold medals. If there's a tie in the number of gold medals, than the
country with more silver medals win. If there's a tie in both gold and silver
medals, the country with more bronze medals should be above. If two or more
nations tie in the three kinds of medals, your program must show them in
alphabetic order.

## Input

Input is the number of participating nations $N (0 \leq N \leq 500)$, followed
by the list of countries and their gold $G (0 \leq G \leq 10000)$, silver $S (0
\leq S \leq 10000)$ and bronze $B (0 \leq B \leq 10000)$ medals.

## Output

Output should be the list of countries and their gold, silver and bronze medals
shown in the specified order.
