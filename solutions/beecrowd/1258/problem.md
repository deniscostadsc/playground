# T-Shirts

Professor Rolien and their Computer Science students are making a polo shirt
that need to be both beautiful and inexpensive. After some meetings, it was
agreed with the students that would be made ​​only black shirts but the
students could choose between the color details (white or red). Therefore,
Rolien needs your help to arrange the lists for all classes for those that
want to by the shirt, relating these shirts by color details, size (P: small),
M or (G:large) and lastly by name.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. Each test case begins with a integer
and positive $N (1 \leq N \leq 60)$, that indicates the amount of shirts that
will be made for that class. The next $2N$ lines contains information of each
shirt (will be two lines of information for each shirt). The first line will
contain the student's name and the second line will contain the color of the
shirt details ("branco" -white or "vermelho" -red) followed by a space and the
size of the shirt "P" "M" or "G". The input ends when the value of $N$ equals
zero (0) and this number should not be processed.

## Output

For each test case print the information sorted by color details in ascending
order, followed by size in descending order and at last, by name in ascending
order, as shown below.

Note: should be printed a blank line between two test cases.
