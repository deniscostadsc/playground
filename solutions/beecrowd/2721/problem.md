# Indecision of Reindeers

This year Santa's Reindeers decided that Rudolph would no longer be the one who
would always be ahead. They would choose, at a fair way, who would lead the
sled. And nothing is fairer than chance.

Then they decidied the following way to choose: Each Reindeer would do as many
snowballs as he wanted without the others seeing. Then all the snowballs of all
the Reindeers would be gathered into a single large pile. Lastly, the snowballs
would be drawn from this stack one by one, and distributed among them always
following the order: Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner,
Blitzen, and Rudolph. Until the snowballs were gone. The reindeer that got the
last snowball would be declared the winner and would be in the main sled
position this year.

Given the number of snowballs made by each Reindeer, determine which Reindeer
won the draw.
