Read an integer $N$. This N will be the number of integer numbers $X$ that
will be read. Print how many these numbers $X$ are in the interval [10,20] and
how many values are out of this interval.

Input

The first line of input is an integer $N (N \lt 10000)$, that indicates the
total number of test cases. Each case is a integer number $X (-10^7 \lt X \lt
10^7)$.

Output

For each test case, print how many numbers are in and how many values are out
of the interval.
