# Og

Og is a caveman with many children, and he wants to count them all. Og counts
his sons with his left hand and his daughters with his right hand.

However, Og is very dumb, and can't add the two counts, so he asked you to
write him a program that will do the addition.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of a single
line containing two integers L and R, separated by a single space, indicating
respectively the number of sons and daughters $(1 \leq L, R \leq 5)$.

The end of input is indicated by $L = R = 0$.

## Output

For each test case in the input print a line containing a single integer
indicating how many children Og has.
