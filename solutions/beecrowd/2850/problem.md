# Polyglot Parrot

Humberto has a smart parrot. When he has both legs on the ground, the parrot
speaks Portuguese. When he lifts his left leg, he speaks in English. Finally,
when he raises his right, he speaks French. Nico, Humberto's friend, was
fascinated by the animal. In his excitement he asked, "And when he lift both of
them?" Before Humberto could respond, the parrot shouted, "Oh, I'll fall, you
idiot!"

## Input

The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of a string
informing the parrot's leg raising situation. “direita” means his right leg is
raised, “esquerda” means his left leg is raised, “nenhuma” means none of his leg
are raised and “as duas” means both his legs are raised.

## Output

For each parrot's leg raising condition, print out the language he will use. For
English, print “ingles”, for French print “frances” and for Portuguese print
“portugues”. If he lifts both legs, print "caiu." Break a line for each test
case.
