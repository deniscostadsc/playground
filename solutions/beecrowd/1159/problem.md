# Sum of Consecutive Even Numbers

Make a program that reads an integer $X$ times (stop when $X = 0$). For each
$X$, print the sum of five consecutive even numbers from $X$, including it if
$X$
is even. If the input number is 4, for example, the output must be 40, that is
the result of the operation: $4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12$. If the input number is 11,
for example, the output must be 80, that is the result of
$12 + 14 + 16 + 18 + 20$.

## Input

The input file contains many integer numbers. The last one is zero.

## Output

Print the output according to the example below.
