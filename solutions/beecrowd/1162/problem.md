# Train Swapping

At an old railway station, you may still encounter one of the last remaining
“train swappers”. A train swapper is an employee of the railroad, whose sole
job it is to rearrange the carriages of trains.

Once the carriages are arranged in the optimal order, all the train driver
has to do, is drop the carriages off, one by one, at the stations for which
the load is meant.

The title “train swapper'' stems from the first person who performed this
task, at a station close to a railway bridge. Instead of opening up vertically,
the bridge rotated around a pillar in the center of the river. After rotating
the bridge 90 degrees, boats could pass left or right.

The first train swapper had discovered that the bridge could be operated with
at most two carriages on it. By rotating the bridge 180 degrees, the carriages
switched place, allowing him to rearrange the carriages (as a side effect, the
carriages then faced the opposite direction, but train carriages can move
either way, so who cares).

Now that almost all train swappers have died out, the railway company would
like to automate their operation. Part of the program to be developed, is a
routine which decides for a given train the least number of swaps of two
adjacent carriages necessary to order the train. Your assignment is to create
that routine.

## Input

The input contains on the first line the number of test cases $(N)$. Each test
case consists of two input lines. The first line of a test case contains an
integer $L$, determining the length of the train $(0 \leq L \leq 50)$. The
second line of a test case contains a permutation of the numbers 1 through $L$,
indicating the current order of the carriages. The carriages should be ordered
such that carriage 1 comes first, then 2, etc. with carriage $L$ coming last.

## Output

For each test case output the sentence: 'Optimal train swapping takes $S$
swaps.' where $S$ is an integer.
