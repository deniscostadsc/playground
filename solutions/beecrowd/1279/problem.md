# Leap Year or Not Leap Year and â€¦

The ancient race of Gulamatu is very advanced in their year calculation
scheme. They understand what leap year is (A year that is divisible by 4 and
not divisible by 100 with the exception that years that are divisible by 400
are also leap year.) and they have also similar festival years. One is the
Huluculu festival (happens on years divisible by 15) and the Bulukulu festival
(Happens on years divisible by 55 provided that is also a leap year). Given an
year you will have to state what properties these years have. If the year is
not leap year nor festival year, then print the line 'This is an ordinary
year.' The order of printing (if present) the properties is leap
year-->huluculu-->bulukulu.

## Input

Input will contain several years as input. Each year will be in separate
lines. Input is terminated by end of file. All the years will not be less than
2000 (to avoid the earlier different rules for leap years) but can have more
than 1000 digits.

## Output

For each input, output the different properties of the years in different
lines according to previous description and sample output. A blank line should
separate the output for each line of input. Note that there are four different
properties.
