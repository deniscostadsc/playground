# Removing Letters

João challenged Pedro in a game involving sequences of letters.

At the beginning, it is shown to the players a sequence of letters. Each
player must try to use this sequence to form other sequences. Therefore, it is
allowed to remove letters of the sequence, without changing the order. The
player who can form more distinct sequences wins the game.

Pedro would like your help to beat João in this game. Your task is to show
Peter all distinct sequences, in alphabetical order, he may form during the
game.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of a line
containing a sequence to be used in the game. The sequence is formed only by
lowercase characters and can contain up to 1000 characters.

## Output

For each test, the output consists of several lines containing all sequences
that may be formed by Pedro during the game. It is guaranteed to all entries
that are no more than 1000 possible sequences to be formed. Print a blank line
after each test case.
