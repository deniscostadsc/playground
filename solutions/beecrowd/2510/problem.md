# Batmain

As everyone knows, there are many heroes who defend humanity from thugs and
evil forces. In Codham, one of the darkest cities that exist, lives Batmain,
the dark knight. Briefly, Batmain is nothing more than a human genius,
multi-billionaire, philanthropist that also is master in over than a hundred
martial arts. Although anyone knows his real identity, because he uses a armor
with bat costume, all good people love him. After several battles, all his
villains were captured by Batmain and the sense of security seemed to be part
of the Codham citizens again. All this atypical tranquility ceased to exist in
two days, when the clown prince of crime – also known as Jokoder ­­– escaped
from Arkham and made the city more chaotic than ever. You work to the police
of Codham, in a recognized work of batprogrammer (job responsible to solve
problems that the Batmain is envolved, with algorithms codes) and was
solicited to you the following mission: answer, to each villain, if he already
was arrested by the dark knight, or not.
