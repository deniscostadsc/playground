# Elf Time

The manufacturing of Christmas gifts is a very complicated task. Several times
the leprechauns stay up late working so that everything can be done in time
and with perfection.

To better manage their schedule, the leprechauns stipulated how many minutes
it takes to manufacture each gift.

Its almost the end of the day, and one of the leprechauns asked for your help.

There're N minutes left for the time to go away, and there are two remaining
gifts for elf Ed to manufacture. Help him to find out if he will manage to
manufacture both gifts today, or if he should delay the work for the next day.

## Input

Each test case starts with a integer $N$, indicating how many minutes there
are until the time to go away ($2 \leq N \leq 100$).

Following there will be two integers A and B, indicating how many minutes it
takes to manufacture each of both gifts Ed has to manufacture
($1 \leq A, B \leq 100$).

## Output

Print one row, containing the statement "Farei hoje!" if it's possible to
manufacture both gifts before the time to go away, or "Deixa para amanha!"
otherwise.
