# Growing Sequences

Your program must read an integer X indefinited times (the program must stop
when X is equal to zero). For each X print the sequence from 1 to X, with one
space between each one of these numbers.

PS: Be carefull. Don't leave any space after the last number of each line,
otherwise you'll get Presentation Error.

## Input

The input file contains many integer numbers. The last one is zero.

## Output

For each number N of the input file, one output line must be printed, from 1
to N like the following example. Be careful with blank spaces after the last
line number.
