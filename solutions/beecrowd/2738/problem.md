# Contest

The Mars Technology University has Open Positions for researchers. However,
the computer responsible for processing the candidates' data is broken. You
must present the candidate list, containing the name and final score (with two
decimal places of precision) of each candidate. Remember to show the list
ordered by score (highest first).

The score is given by the weighted average described as:

$$Avg = \cfrac{(math \times 2) + (specific \times 3) + (project\_plan \times 5)}{10}$$
