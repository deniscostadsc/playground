# OBI URI

Mariazinha created an exercise for her sisters Paula and Marta: she
distributes a text and asks both to correct this text, knowing that only the
OBI and URI words may be written incorrectly, and the error can be only in the
last letter.

Your task here is automatize this process, creating a program to make the
correction of the texts distributed by Mariazinha in order to check the
corrections of her sisters without much work.

Note that if "OB" or "UR" were part of a larger word (for example, "OBOS"), it
should not be altered.

## Input

The input contains two lines. The first line contain a integer number $N (1
\lt N \lt 10000)$ that indicates the amount of text words. The second line
contains these text words, each one with up to 20 characters ('A'-'Z'),
inclusive, or at least, one letter ('A'-'Z').

The input contains several test cases. Each test case is composed by one line
that contais a string sentence. This string will contain between 1 and 50
characters ('A'-'Z','a'-'z' or space ' '), inclusive, or at least, one letter
('A'-'Z','a'-'z').

## Output

Your program must correct the text distributed by Mariazinha, according to the
criteria above defined.
