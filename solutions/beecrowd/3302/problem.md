# Correct Answer

Roumes was an above average student. In math tests, he always got a maximum
score, getting all the maths right, but his secret wasn't in doing the math
correctly. He interpreted what he saw in the environment around him and he could
deduce the answers to the questions. You too can be someone special, just like
Roumes.

## Input

Input consists of several test cases. Each case contains a number $N$,
representing the number of questions. The next $N$ lines show what you saw to
get to the answer.

## Output

For each question asked, print the word 'resposta', followed by a space, then
the question number, a colon, a space and the answer.
