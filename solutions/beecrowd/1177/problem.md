# Array Fill II

Write a program that reads a number $T$ and fill a vector $N[1000]$ with the
numbers from $0$ to $T-1$ repeated times, like as the example below.

## Input

The input contains an integer number $T (2 \leq T \leq 50)$.

## Output

For each position of the array $N$, print "$N[i] = x$", where i is the array
position and $x$ is the number stored in that position.
