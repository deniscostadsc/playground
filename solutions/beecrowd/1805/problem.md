# Natural Sum

One natural number is a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,...). Your task
in this problem is to calculate the sum of the natural numbers that are
present in a given interval [A, B] including.

For instance, the sum of the natural numbers in the range [2, 5] is 14 = (2 +
3 + 4 + 5).

## Input

The test case contains two integers $A$ e $B (1 \leq A \leq B \leq 10^9)$,
representing the lower limit and the upper respectively.

## Output

For each test, the output consists of one line containing the sum of natural
numbers in the range.
