# HameKameKa

The Hamekameka was invented by Master Hame practiced for fifty years before
meeting Kogu. Calling his latent energy in the palms of his hands, Hame manages
to launch an explosive bolt of energy. Kogu learns after seeing Master Hame
using it to extinguish the flames in a King's house. To Hame's surprise, Kogu
manages to perform the First-rate technique, though it is only strong enough to
destroy the car that Chamya gave to Mulba. Kogu has discovered that there is a
pattern in the correct pronunciation of this attack, so that if it is not
pronounced correctly, it does not.

Write a program that, given the initial part of a Hamekameka, makes the ideal
ending for the attack to be successful.

## Input

The input begins with a value $C$, indicating the number of test cases. Next, we
have $C$ lines, each with the beginning of an attack, with a maximum of 200
letters.

## Output

For each test case, print out the appropriate finalization so that the attack be
successful.
