statistical result of several GRENAIS. Write a program that read the number of
goals scored by Inter and the number of goals scored by Grêmio in a GRENAL.
Write the message "Novo grenal (1-sim 2-nao)" and request a response. If the
answer is 1, two new numbers must be readed (another input case) asking the
number of goals scored by the teams in a new departure, otherwise the program
must be finished, printing:

- How GRENAIS were part of the statistics.
- The number of victories of Inter.
- The number of victories of the Grêmio.
- The number of Draws.
- A message indicating the team that won the largest number of GRENAIS (or the
  message: "Nao houve vencedor" if both team won the same quantity of GRENAIS.

both teams. Then there is an integer (1 or 2), corresponding to the repetition
of the algorithm.

## Output
