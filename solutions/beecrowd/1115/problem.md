# Quadrant

Write a program to read the coordinates (X, Y) of an indeterminate number of
points in Cartesian system. For each point write the quadrant to which it
belongs. The program finish when at least one of two coordinates is NULL
(in this situation without writing any message).

## Input

The input contains several tests cases. Each test case contains two integer
numbers.

## Output

For each test case, print the corresponding quadrant which these coordinates
belong, like as the example.
