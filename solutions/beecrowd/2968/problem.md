# Hour for a Run

Vinicius takes his fitness very seriously, and every morning at 6 a.m., rain or
shine, in summer and winter, he runs in a track around a pond. Along the race
track there are $N$ equally spaced signs. To not be discouraged from exercising,
Vinicius counts the number of signs he has passed and checks to see if he has
run at least 10%, at least 20%, ... , at least 90% of his training.

Letâ€™s help Vinicius by calculating for him the number of signs he needs to count
to have completed at least 10%, 20%, ... , 90% of his training, given the number
of laps he wants to run and the total number of signs along the track

For example, suppose Vinicius wants to run 3 laps and the track has 17 signs. To
ensure that he has run at least 30% of his training, he needs to count 16 signs.
To guarantee at least 60%, he needs to count 31 signs.

## Input

The input consists of a single line, which contains two integers, $V$ and $N (1
\leq V, N \leq 10^4 )$, where V is the desired number of laps and $N$ is the
number of signs along the track.

## Output

Your program must output a single line, containing nine integers, representing
the numbers of signs that must be counted to ensure that at least 10%, 20%, ...
, 90% of the training has been completed, respectively.
