# Experiments

Maria has just started as graduate student in a medical school and
she's needing your help to organize a laboratory experiment which she
is responsible about. She wants to know, at the end of the year, how
many animals were used in this laboratory and the percentage of each
type of animal is used at all.

This laboratory uses in particular three types of animals: frogs,
rats and rabbits. To obtain this information, it knows exactly the
number of experiments that were performed, the type and quantity of
each animal is used in each experiment.

## Input

The first line of input contains an integer $N$ indicating the number
of test cases that follows. Each test case contains an integer $Amount$
($1 \leq Amount \leq 15$) which represents the amount of animal used and a
character Type ('C', 'R' or 'S'), indicating the type of animal:

- C: Coelho (rabbit in portuguese)
- R: Rato (rat  in portuguese)
- S: Sapo (frog in portuguese)

## Output

Print the total of animals used, the total of each type of animal
and the percentual of each one in relation of the total of animals
used. The percentual must be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point.
