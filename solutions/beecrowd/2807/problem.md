# Iccanobif

Iccanobif sequences are sequences where each term is always equal to the sum of
the next two subsequent to it. Except for the last two terms which are always
equal to 1

Example of an Iccanobif sequence with 10 terms: 55, 34, 21, 13, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1,
1.

Your task is, given an integer value, print the corresponding size Iccanobif
sequence.

## Input

The entry consists of a single integer $N (1 \leq N \leq 40)$ representing the
size of the desired Iccanobif sequence.

## Output

The output consists of a single line containing the terms of the Iccanobif
sequence of $N$ size separated by a single space.
