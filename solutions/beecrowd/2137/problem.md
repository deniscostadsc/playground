# The Library of Mr. Severino

In a quiet country town, Mr. Severino has decided to set up his own library,
as he collects several books since his youth. He knows nothing about
programming, so he asked his grandson to make a program that registers and
sorts his books by their code. However, his grandson is still in elementary
school, and since he knows very little about programming, he ended up making a
program that only registers the books, but doesn't sort them.

Thereby, Severino has turned to you, because he knows about your programming
skills. Your task is simple: sort the books by their code.

## Input

The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each test case
contains an integer $N (1 \leq N \leq 1000)$. The subsequent $N$ lines will
have the books' code, which are always in the form "xxxx", that is, there will
be no registration '1', for example, but "0001". Read input until EOF.

## Output

Print the registration of the books' code sorted. There's no newline between
the test cases.
