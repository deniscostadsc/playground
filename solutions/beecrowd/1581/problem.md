# International Chat

Rafael recently won a scholarship and is studying outside of Brazil, where he
met several people from several different nationalities. The native language
of this country is English, and all the people that Rafael met speak English
as either first or second language.

As learning a second language is a hard and tiring task, some people prefer to
talk in their own native language whenever possible. One exception to this
rule is when there are two people in the group that doesn't have the same
native language. In this kind of situation, the language they speak is
English.

For example, if there is a group with only brazilians, the spoken language
will be Portuguese, but if there is a spanish person between them, the spoken
language will be English.

Rafael sometimes get confused about which language should be spoken in each
group of people, and then he asked your help.

## Input

The first line will contain an integer $N$, representing the number of test
cases to follow.

Each test case starts with an integer $K (2 \leq K \leq 100)$, representing
the number of people in the group. Following there will be $K$ lines,
containing a string S each, representing the native language of these $K$
people.

Each string will contain at least 1 and at most 20 characters, with lower case
letters only (a-z).

## Output

Print one line, containing a string S, representing the most appropriate
language for the situation.
