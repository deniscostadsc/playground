# Come and Go

In a certain city there are $N$ intersections connected by one-way and two-way
streets. It is a modern city, and several of the streets have tunnels or
overpasses. Evidently it must be possible to travel between any two
intersections. More precisely given two intersections $V$ and $W$ it must be
possible to travel from $V$ to $W$ and from $W$ to $V$.

Your task is to write a program that reads a description of the city street
system and determines whether the requirement of connectedness is satisfied or
not.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains
two integers N and M, separated by a space, indicating the number of
intersections ($2 \leq N \leq 2000$) and number of streets
($2 \leq M \leq N(Nâˆ’1)/2$). The next M lines describe the city street system,
with each line describing one street. A street description consists of
three integers V, W and P, separated by a blank space, where V and W are
distinct identifiers for intersections ($1 \leq V, W \leq N , V \neq W$) and $P$
can be 1 or 2; if $P = 1$ the street is one-way, and traffic goes from $V$ to $W$;
if $P = 2$ then the street is two-way and links $V$ and $W$. A pair of
intersections is connected by at most one street.

The last test case is followed by a line that contains only two zero numbers
separated by a blank space.

## Output

For each test case your program should print a single line containing an
integer G, where G is equal to one if the condition of connectedness is
satisfied, and G is zero otherwise.
