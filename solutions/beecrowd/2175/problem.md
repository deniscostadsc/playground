# What is the Fastest?

Otavio, Bruno and Ian are childhood friends, passionate about challenges and
water sports. In Olympic times they challenge each other, simulating some
competitions such as swimming. The problem is that swimming, for example, they
train enough together and sometimes the time difference between them is very
short, due to this, in most cases they are hours and hours discussing who won.
Now they decided to invest in the development of electronic equipment to be used
specifically in swimming, which identifies the time that each swam and displays
who was the fastest. You're part of the team that will develop the equipment and
your task in the project is to create a program to receive the time of 3 friends
and say who was the winner.

## Input

Each test case consists of a single line containing three numbers, separated by
a blank space, $O (0 \leq O \leq 100)$, $B (0 \leq B \leq 100)$ and $I (0 \leq I
\leq 100)$, representing respectively the time in seconds of Otavio, Bruno and
Ian. Times will have a maximum of 3 decimal places.

## Output

For each test case, your program must print a single line containing the name of
the winning competitor, the fastest. If there is a tie and you can not determine
a single winner, you should print the word "Empate" (it means tie in Portuguese)
without quotes.
