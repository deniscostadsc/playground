# Subsequences

Given two sequences, decide if the later is a subsequence of the first one.

## Input

Input starts with an integer $N (0 \lt N \leq 10)$, representing the number of
test cases. Then there are the description of the $N$ test cases. Each test case
starts with a sequence $S (S$ in $[a-zA-Z], 0 \lt |S| \lt 100000)$ and an
integer $Q (0 \lt Q \leq 1000)$, the number of queries. The next $Q$ lines
describes each the second sequence $R (R$ in $[a-zA-Z], 0 \lt |R| \lt 100)$.

## Output

For each querie $R$, print "Yes" (no quotes) if R is a subsequence of S, or "No"
(no quotes) otherwise.
