# Sorting Santa's List of Children

Santa Claus is in finishing to organize the delivery of gifts to all the
children of the world because Christmas is coming again. Looking at his new
lists of children who will win gifts this year he realized that the trainee
elf (who had been responsable for making the lists) did not put the names in
alphabetical order.

As Santa is a very organized man, he wants that every list of children have,
at its end, the total number of children who were well behaved this year and
the total of those who were not. Then he can compare the number of children
that was behaved in this year and in previous ones.

To help the good old man, your function is to create a program that reads all
the names in the list and prints the same names in alphabetical order. At the
bottom of the list, you should print the total number of children who were
good behaved and the ones who were not.

## Input

The input consists of several names. The first value $N (0 \leq N \leq 100)$,
indicates how many names there are on the list. The next $N$ lines have one
special character that matches with the behavior of the child (+ indicates
that the child was well behaved, - indicates that the child misbehaved). After
the special character, follows the name of the children with 20 characteres at
maximum.

## Output

For each list of children, you should print the names in alphabetical order.
After print the names, you must show the total number of children that were
well behaved ("Se comportaram: ") and misbehaved during the year ("Nao se
comportaram: ").
