Array according to the above example.

## Input

The input consists of several integers numbers, one per line, corresponding to
orders from arrays to be built. The end of input is indicated by zero (0).

## Output

For each integer number of input, print the corresponding array according to
the example. (the values ​​of the arrays must be formatted in a field of size
3 right justified and separated by a space. None space must be printed after
the last character of each row of the array. A blank line must be printed
