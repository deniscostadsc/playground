# Justifier II

We have some texts and we want to right justify them, that is, align them to the
right. Create a program that reads a text, formats it right justifies all of its
lines, printing them in the same order as they appear in the input.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case will
contain an integer $N (1 \leq N \leq 100)$ indicating the number of lines that
form the text. Each of the following $N$ lines will contain a text, composed of 1
to 50 uppercase letters (‘A’-‘Z’) or spaces (‘ ’). All text lines will contain
at least one letter. There may be more than one space character between words.
Also, there may be leading and trailing spaces in the input lines. The end of
input is indicated by $N = 0$.

## Output

For each test case print the text lines with a single space character between
words, and padded on the left with space characters so that all the lines will
have the same length as the longest line existing in that text. Print an empty
line between all the test cases. There must be no trailing spaces printed out,
and you should discard any unnecessary leading spaces, so that at least one line
on every text starts with a letter.
