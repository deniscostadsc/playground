# Umil Bolt

Umil Bolt is an excellent runner. His specialty is the 100-meter race. Every
day, he makes a battery of attempts to run this test in an ever faster time. It
can be seen that, depending on the number of attempts, its performance improves
or worsens. About this, he asks for your help to calculate the fastest attempt
of each daily battery.

## Input

The input is composed of several test cases. The first line of each test case
contains an integer $T (2 \leq T \leq 99)$ relative to the number of trials of a
day. The following $T$ lines contain a real number $T_i (9 \leq T_i \leq 11)$
relative to the time, in seconds, of the ith battery attempt. The entry ends
with end of file.

## Output

For each test case of your program entry, you must print a real number
containing the time of the fastest attempt of each battery.
