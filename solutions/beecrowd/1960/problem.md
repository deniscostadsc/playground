# Roman Numerals for Page Numbers

The ECI (Editio Chronica Incredibilis or Amazing Chronicles Editors) is very
traditional when numbering the pages of its books. It always uses the Roman
numerals for that. And its books never have more than 999 pages. When
necessary, the books are split into volumes.

You must write a program that, given an arabic number, show its equivalent in
roman numerals.

Remember that I stands for 1, V for 5, X for 10, L for 50, C for 100, D for
500 and M stands for 1000.

## Input

The input is a positive integer number $N (0 \lt N \lt 1000)$.

## Output

The output is the number N written as Roman numerals in a single line. Always
use uppercase letters.
