# Big Word

Recently Juquinha learned to say big words. These Brazilian Portuguese words are
commonly called "palavrao"s. Amazed at the discovery of the boy, her mother
forbade him to say any "palavrao", about the risk of the boy losing his
allowance.

As Juquinha hates being without an allowance, he hired you to develop a program
to tell him if a word is a "palavrao" or not.

"Palavrao"s are words that contain ten or more characters, all other words are
considered "palavrinha"s.

## Input

Input consists of several test cases. Each case contains a string that describes
the word that Juquinha wants to look up. This string is made up of only
lowercase letters and its length does not exceed 20 characters.

## Output

For each test case, print whether the word Juquinha consulted is a "palavrao"
(big word) or a "palavrinha" (other words).
