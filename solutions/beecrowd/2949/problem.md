# The Fellowship of the Ring

Frodo was a little hobbit (small, hairy-footed people) who lived quietly in the
Shire, taking his various breakfasts filled with many succulent foods that a
good hobbit diet provides. One day his Uncle Bilbo hands him his famous golden
ring, and Gandalf, a very "cool" mage, tells Frodo that this ring was not normal
and should be thrown on the Mountain of Doom, so that a great evil would be
avoided. For this journey, an entourage was formed, composed of dwarves, elves,
humans, hobbits and magicians. Frodo wants to know the amount of each race that
will go with him for the journey. Given a list of people who enlisted, report
back to Frodo from the entourage.

# Input

The first line of the entry is composed of an integer $N (0 \lt N \leq 10)$,
indicating the number of people who enlisted. Each of the next $N$ Next lines
are composed of a string (without spaces and of alphanumeric characters only)
and a capital character, indicating, respectively, the name and the type of the
race of the respective being. This character may be:

 - A - For dwarves;
 - E - For elves;
 - H - For humans;
 - M - For magicians;
 - X - For hobbits (X, because every hobbit is a mystery to the world).

# Output

A report should be presented with Frodo's entourage, indicating in each line how
many beings of each species will be on the journey, following the order:
hobbits, humans, elves, dwarves and magicians (in Portuguese).
