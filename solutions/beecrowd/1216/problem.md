# Getline One

Mangojata is learning Computer Programming. She finds everything very easy,
very simple. She is going to make a small program that reads the names of your
friends and the distance from his home to each of them. Therefore, she simply
want to calculate what is the average distance between her house and her
friends house (in meters). But Aristoclenes, a much more experienced
programmer warned her that sometimes what seems simple can have some details,
depending on the programming language used for implementation.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. Each test case is composed by two
lines. The first line contains the name of a friend of Mangojata. The second
line contains an integer number that indicates the average distance between
Mangojata's house and the house of a friend.

## Output

The output must be a number with one digit after the decimal point indicating
the average distance between Mangojata's house and the house of her friends,
like the following example.
