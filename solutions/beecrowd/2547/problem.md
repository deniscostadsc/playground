# Roller Coaster

Everyone in Nlogônia is really excited with the opening of Ricardo Barreiro
World, the newest amusement park in the country. Its roller coaster, the
fastest in the continent, is being widely advertised on TV and Radio. It’s the
attraction everyone, from kids to grandmas, wants to ride.

Unfortunately, some restrictions were imposed by the government during the
attraction’s homologation. For safety reasons, there is a minimum and a
maximum height people must have to ride the roller coaster.

In the inauguration day, every guest filled a register in which they indicated
their heights. In order to reduce lines and optimize the operation, you were
hired to write a program that, given the number of guests, the minimum and
maximum allowed height, and the height of every guest, determine how many
guests are allowed to ride the roller coaster.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case
contains three integers $N (1 \leq N \leq 100)$, $A_{min}$ and $A_{max} (50
\leq A_{min} \leq A_{max} \leq 250)$, the number of guests, the minimum and
the maximum allowed height, respectively, in centimeters.

Each of the next $N$ lines contains an integer $(50 \leq A_i \leq 250)$, the
height of the $i$-th guest, in centimeters.

The input ends with end-of-file (EOF).

## Output

For each test case, print a single line containing the number of guests
allowed to ride the roller coaster.
