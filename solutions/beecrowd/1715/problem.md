# Handball

Frustrated and disappointed with the results of its football team, the Super
Brazilian Club (SBC) decided to invest in the handball team. In order to
better rate the players, the coaches would like to analyse their regularity.
Specifically, they are interested in knowing how many players scored goals in
all matches.

As the data volume is very big, they would like to have a computer program to
do this counting.

## Input

The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains
two integers $N$ and $M (1 \leq N \leq 100 \space and \space 1 \leq M \leq
100)$ indicating, respectively, the number of players and the number of
matches. Each one of the next $N$ lines describes the performance of one
player: the i-th line contains $M$ integers $X_j (0 \leq X_j \leq 100, \space
for \space 1 \leq j \leq M )$, giving the number of goals that the i-th player
scored in each match.

## Output

For each test case in the input your program must output one line, containing
one integer, the number of players that scored goals in all matches!
