# Primary Arithmetic

Children are taught to add multi-digit numbers from right-to-left one digit at
a time. Many find the "carry" operation - in which a 1 is carried from one
digit position to be added to the next - to be a significant challenge. Your
job is to count the number of carry operations for each of a set of addition
problems so that educators may assess their difficulty.

## Input

Each line of input contains two unsigned integers less than 10 digits. The
last line of input contains 0 0.

## Output

For each line of input except the last you should compute and print the number
of carry operations that would result from adding the two numbers, in the
format shown below.
