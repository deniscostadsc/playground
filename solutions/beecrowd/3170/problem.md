# Christmas Balls

Amelia loves Christmas, and her favorite part on this date is setting up the
Christmas tree! She loves to decorate the tree with polka dots and colorful
lights, so it looks bright and fun! However, Amélia likes things well
distributed and demands that her tree has no more than half of branches in
balls. So, if your Christmas tree has $G$ branches, it needs *G / 2* marbles. If
the $G$ number of branches is odd, that value will be rounded down.

This year, Amélia decided to update her tree and will buy a new one. Also, some
of her balls broke, and she will need to know how many new balls she will need
to buy to keep her tree balanced the way she likes it!

For that, she wants your help! Given the number of balls Amelia has and the
number of branches her new tree will have, tell Amelia how many Christmas balls
she needs to buy to decorate her new tree!

## Input

The input consists of two integer values, read on two lines, $B (1 \lt B \lt
10^3)$ and $G (100 \lt G \lt 1000)$ indicating, respectively, the number of
balls that Amélia already has and the number of branches of her new Christmas
tree.

## Output

Print the number of balls Amélia needs to buy to complete her tree, with the
message "Faltam $B$ bolinha(s)" (in English, Missing $B$ ball(s)), where $B$ is
the number of balls that Amelia needs to buy. If Amelia has enough balls to
spare, print the message "Amelia tem todas bolinhas!" (in English, "Amelia has
all balls!")
