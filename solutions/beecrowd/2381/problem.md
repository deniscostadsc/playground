# Call List

Joana is a respected teacher and has several students. In her last class, she
promised that she would raffle off a student to earn a special bonus on the
final grade: she put N pieces of paper numbered from 1 to N in a bag and drew
a certain number K; the winning student was the Kth student on the roll call.

The problem is that Joana forgot her class diary, so she has no way of knowing
which number corresponds to which student. She knows the names of all the
students, and that their numbers, from 1 to N, are assigned in alphabetical
order, but her students are very anxious and want to know right away who was
the winner.

Given the names of Joana's students and the number drawn, determine the name
of the student who should receive the bonus.

## Input

The first line contains two integers $N$ and $K$ separated by a blank space
$(1 â‰¤ K \leq N \leq 100)$. Each of the following $N$ lines contains a string
of minimum length 1 and maximum length 20 representing the names of the
students. Names are made up of all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.

## Output

Your program must print a single line, containing the name of the student who
is to receive the bonus.
