# Divisibility by 3

In the world of mathematics to find out if a number is divisible by another
there is a rule called severability rule. A natural number is divisible by 3 as
the sum of all its digits forms a number divisible by 3, i.e. a multiple of 3 .

Ex1: 1.104 is divisible by 3?

Answer: “YES”. It is divisible by 3 , when added as their numbers : 1 + 1 + 0 +
4 = 6 , which is a number divisible by 3 (because 6 ÷ 3 = 2, which is a natural
number).

Ex1: 2.791.035 is divisible by 3?

Answer: “YES” . 2791035 consists of figures added : 9 + 7 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 3 + 5 =
27 , generates a number divisible by 3 (because 27 ÷ 3 = 9 , natural number).

## Input

The input file contains two numbers $n (1 \lt n \lt 10)$ indicating the number
of digits $m (1 \lt m \lt 1000000000)$.

The input ends with end of file (EOF).

## Output

Your program should provide the number of the sum of the digits of m and after
presenting "sim" if the number is divisible by 3 or "nao" if not. Do not forget
the finish line after the product, otherwise your program will display the
message: "Presentation Error".
