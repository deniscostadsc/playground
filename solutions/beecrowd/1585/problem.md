# Making Kites

Anastasia really loves to build kites to her friends. Peter, knowing that,
took some bamboo pieces from the furniture factory of his uncle that it would
be descarted, to give to Anastasia. When Peter gave the bamboos to her, he
asked what was the biggest kite that could be built with those patches of
bamboo. Anastasia, that is not very good with calculus, wants you to help her
with this task.

Note .: Each kite is built with two pieces of bamboo tied cross-shaped,
forming a lozenge.

## Input

The input contains many test cases. The first line of input contains an
integer N that represents the among of kites that will be built. Each one of
the N following lines contains two integer numbers $x$ ($10 \leq x \leq 100$)
and $y$ ($10 \leq y \leq 100$) that indicates the size of the two bambus used
to built the kite.

## Output

For each test case, print a truncate integer number corresponding to the area
of the kite created, in $cm^2$, followed by a blank space and the text "cm2",
without the quotes.
