# Counting Point Mutations

Given two strings s and t of equal length, the Hamming distance between s and t,
denoted dH(s,t), is the number of corresponding symbols that differ in s and t.
See Figure 2.

these two strings is 7. Mismatched symbols are colored red")

Given: Two DNA strings s and t of equal length (not exceeding 1 kbp).

Return: The Hamming distance dH(s,t).
