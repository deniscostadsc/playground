This initial problem is aimed at familiarizing you with Rosalind's
task-solving pipeline. To solve it, you merely have to take a given
DNA sequence and find its nucleotide counts; this problem is equivalent
to “Counting DNA Nucleotides” in the Stronghold.

Of the many tools for DNA sequence analysis, one of the most popular
is the Sequence Manipulation Suite. Commonly known as SMS 2, it comprises
a collection of programs for generating, formatting, and analyzing short
strands of DNA and polypeptides.

One of the simplest SMS 2 programs, called DNA stats, counts the number
of occurrences of each nucleotide in a given strand of DNA. An online
interface for DNA stats can be found here.

Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 bp.

Return: Four integers (separated by spaces) representing the respective
number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in s. Note:
You must provide your answer in the format shown in the sample output below.
