# Weird Algorithm

Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n is even,
the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by
three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n is one. For example, the
sequence for n=3 is as follows:

$$ 3 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 4
\rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1$$

Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of n.

## Input

The only input line contains an integer n.

## Output

Print a line that contains all values of n during the algorithm.

## Constraints

$1 \le n \le 10^6$

## Example
### Input:
3

### Output:
3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
