# Ackermann Functions

An Ackermann function has the characteristic that the length of the sequence of
numbers generated by the function cannot be computed directly from the input
value. One particular integer Ackermann function is the following:

$Xn+1 = Xn / 2 ( if \space x \space is \space even) \newline
\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space      3Xn + 1 (if \space x \space is \space odd)$

This Ackermann has the characteristic that it eventually converges on 1. A few
examples follow in which the starting value is shown in square brackets
followed by the sequence of values that are generated, followed by the length
of the sequence in curly braces:

     [10] 5 16 8 4 2 1 {6}
     [13] 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 {9}
     [14] 7 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 {17}
     [19] 58 29 88 44 22 ... 2 1 {20}
     [32] 16 8 4 2 1 {5}
     [1] 4 2 1 {3}

## Input and Output

Your program is to read in a series of pairs of values that represent the first
and last numbers in a closed sequence. For each closed sequence pair determine
which value generates the longest series of values before it converges to 1.
The largest value in the sequence will not be larger than can be accomodated in
a 32-bit Pascal LongInt or C long. The last pair of values will be 0, 0. The
output from your program should be as follows:

Between L and H, V generates the longest sequence of S values.

Where:

L = the lower boundary value in the sequence

H = the upper boundary value in the sequence

V = the first value that generates the longest sequence, (if two or more values
generate the longest sequence then only show the lower value) S = the length of
the generated sequence.

In the event that two numbers in the interval should both produce equally long
sequences, report the first.

## Sample Input

```
1 20
35 55
0 0
```

## Sample Output

Between 1 and 20, 18 generates the longest sequence of 20 values.
Between 35 and 55, 54 generates the longest sequence of 112 values.
