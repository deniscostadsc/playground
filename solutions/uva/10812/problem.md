# Beat the Spread!

Superbowl Sunday is nearly here. In order to pass the time waiting
for the half-time commercials and wardrobe malfunctions, the local
hackers have organized a betting pool on the game. Members place their
bets on the sum of the two final scores, or on the absolute difference
between the two scores.

Given the winning numbers for each type of bet, can you deduce the final
scores?

The first line of input contains n, the number of test cases. n lines follow,
each representing a test case. Each test case gives s and d, non-negative
integers representing the sum and (absolute) difference between the two
final scores. For each test case, output a line giving the two final scores, largest first. If there
are no such scores, output a line containing "impossible". Recall that football
scores are always non-negative integers.
