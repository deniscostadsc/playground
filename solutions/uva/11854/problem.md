# Egypt

A long time ago, the Egyptians figured out that a triangle with sides
of length 3, 4, and 5 had a right angle as its largest angle. You must
determine if other triangles have a similar property.

## The Input

Input represents several test cases, followed by a line containing 0 0 0.
Each test case has three positive integers, less than 30,000, denoting
the lengths of the sides of a triangle.

## The Output

For each test case, a line containing "right" if the triangle is a right
triangle, and a line containing "wrong" if the triangle is not a right triangle.
