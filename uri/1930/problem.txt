Finally, the team from the University managed to qualify for the Finals of the
SBC Programming Marathon. The three members of the team and their coach are
looking forward to represent the university, and besides trainining very much,
prepare with every detail your trip to São Paulo, where will be held the
National Final.

They plan to carry with them all their electronic devices: mobile phone,
tablet, laptop, wifi hotspot, camera, etc, and know they will need several
power outlets to connect all these devices. They were told that the four will
be in the same hotel room, but have been advised that in each room there is
only one available power outlet.

Prevented, the three members of the team and the coach bought each a power
strip, thus connect several devices at one outlet of the hotel room; they may
also connect one another in strip to further increase the number of available
sockets. However, as the rules have many outlets, they asked you to write a
program that, given the number of outlets in each rule, determine the maximum
number of devices that can be connected to the energy in the same instant.

Input

The input consists of a line with four integers T1, T2, T3, T4, indicating the
number of taken from each of the four strips (2 ≤ Ti ≤ 6).

Output

Your program should produce a single line containing a single integer
indicating the maximum number of devices that can be connected to the energy in
the same instant.
