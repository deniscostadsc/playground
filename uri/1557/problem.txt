Write a program that read an integer number N (0 ≤ N ≤ 15) that correspont to
the order of a bidimentional array of integers, and build the array according
to the above example.

Input

The input consists of several integers numbers, one per line, corresponding to
orders from arrays to be built. The end of input is indicated by zero (0).

Output

For each integer number of input, print the corresponding array according to
the example. The values of the array must be formatted in a field
of size T right justified and separated by a space, where T is equal to the
number of digits of the biggest number in the array. None space must be printed
after the last character of each row of the array. A blank line must be printed
after each array.
