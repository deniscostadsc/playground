Paula loves math. Her main hobby is to inventing games or activities to play
with her friends. Obviously, not all of them are so passionated about mathematics
and have a lot of difficulty to solve the games offered by her. Now Paula has
invented a small hobby that involves three characters: a numerical digit, one
letter and one numeric digit. 
 
If the letter is uppercase, you need to subtract the first digit of the second one.
If the letter is lowercase, both digts must be added. If the DIGITS are the same,
the product between these two digits must be presented. She asked his friend Marcelo,
who is good at programming, to create a program that print the solution for each sequence
created by Paula.

Input

The input contains many test cases. The first line of each input contains a single integer N,
indicating the number of following test cases. Each test case is a sequence of three chars
created by Paula. This sequence contains in the first position a character between '0' and
'9', a uppercase or lowercase character and another character between '0' and '9'.

Output

For each test case, one line must be printed with  the solution for each sequence
created by Paula
