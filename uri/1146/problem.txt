Your program must read an integer X indefinited times
(the program must stop when X is equal to zero). For each
X print the sequence from 1 to X, with one space between
each one of these numbers.

PS: Be carefull. Don't leave any space after the last number
of each line, otherwise you'll get Presentation Error.

Input

The input file contains many integer numbers. The last one
is zero.

Output

For each number N of the input file, one output line must
be printed, from 1 to N like the following example. Be
careful with blank spaces after the last line number.
