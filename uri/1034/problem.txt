Every year, artists from around the world came to the city, where they make
giant ice sculptures. The city becomes an open sky art gallery, since the
sculptures are exposed in the street for weeks, without melting. This is
because the average winter temperature in Harbin (time that will occur at the
end of the world ICPC) is -20 degrees.

The first step in making the sculpture is to assemble a large block of ice with
the size requested by the artist. The blocks are cutted from the glaciers of
Harbin in blocks of standard height and depth, and several different lengths.
The artist can determine the length he wishes his block of ice and the
sculpture can begin to be carved.

The lengths of the available blocks are {a1; a2; ...;  aN} and wished length by
the artist is M. The block with length = 1 is widely used, for this reason he
always appears in the list of available blocks. Your task is to find the
minimum number of blocks such that the sum of their lengths is M.

Input

In the first line of the input there is an integer T indicating the number of
test cases. Each test case contains two positive integer numbers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 25)
and M (1 ≤ M ≤ 1000000). The number N represents the quantity of block types
and the all size wished by the artist, respectively. The next line contains
a1; a2; ...; aN integers, where (1 ≤ a1 ≤ 100) for all i (1,2,...N) separated
by a blank space.

Output

For each test case print the minimum needed blocks to get a block with M
length.
