Write an program to read two scores of a student. Calculate and print
the semester average. The program must accepts only valid scores
(a score must fit in the range [0.10]). Each score must be validated
separately.

The program must print a message "novo calculo (1-sim 2-nao)" that means
"new calculate (1-yes 2-no)". After, the input will be (1 or 2). 1 means a
new calculation, 2 means that the execution must be finished.
Input

The input file contains several positive or negative floating-point values​.
After the input of 2 valid scores, an integer number X will be read. If
(2 < X < 1 ) the message "novo calculo (1-sim 2-nao)" must be printed again
and a new integer number must be read.
Output

If an invalid score is read, must be printed the message "nota invalida".
When two valid scores are read, the message "media = " must be printed
folowwed by the average between these 2 scores.

The output average must be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point.
