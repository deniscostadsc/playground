You will be given N points on a circle. You must write a program to
determine how many distinct equilateral triangles can be constructed using
the given points as vertices.

The figure below illustrates an example: (a) shows a set of points, determined
by the lengths of the circular arcs that have adjacent points as extremes;
and (b) shows the two triangles which can be built with these points.

Input

The input contains several test cases and ends with EOF. The first line of a
test case contains an integer N ( 3 ≤ N ≤ 105), the number of points given. The
second line contains N integers Xi (1 ≤ Xi ≤ 103) for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, representing
the lengths of the circular arcs between two consecutive points in the circle:
for 1 ≤ i ≤ (N − 1), Xi represents the length of the arc between between points
i and i + 1; XN represents the length of the arc between points N and 1.

Output

For each test case your program must output a single line, containing a single
integer, the number of distinct equilateral triangles that can be constructed
using the given points as vertices.
