In the school you study, the recreation time is the most awaited time by most
of the students. Not just because the classes sometimes are tiring, but because
the lunch is very good.

When the recreation alarm sounds, all the students go out running from the
class to arrive as early as possible in the canteen, such is the desire to eat.
One of your teachers noticed that there was an opportunity there.

Using a reward system, your math teacher decided that the order in which the
students will be served will not be given by the arrival time, but by the sum
of grades obtained in class. In this way, those with higher grades can be
served before those with lower grades.

Your task is simple: given the arrival time of the students in the canteen, and
their respective grades in the math class, reorder the queue according to the
math grades, and say how many students don't need to change place in this
reordering.

Input

The first line contains an integer N, indicating the number of test cases to
follow.

Each test case starts with an integer M (1 ≤ M ≤ 1000), indicating the number
of students. Following there will be M distinct integers Pi (1 ≤ Pi ≤ 1000),
where the i-th integer indicates the grade of the i-th student.

The above integers are given in the arrival order, or in other words, the first
integer is from the first student to get to the queue, the second integer is
from the second student, and so on.

Output

For each test case print one line, containing one integer, indicating the
number of students that don't need to change their places even after the queue
being reordered.
