Read 3 floating-point values (A, B and C) representing the sides
of a triangle and arrange them in decreasing order, so that the
side A is the biggest of the three sides. Next, determine the
type of triangle that they can make, based on the following cases
always writing an appropriate message:

if A > B + C, write the message: NAO FORMA TRIANGULO
if A^2 = B^2 + C^2, write the message: TRIANGULO RETANGULO
if A^2 > B^2 + C^2, write the message: TRIANGULO OBTUSANGULO
if A^2 < B^2 + C^2, write the message: TRIANGULO ACUTANGULO
if the three sides are the same size, write the message: TRIANGULO EQUILATERO
if only two sides are the same and the third one is different,
write the message: TRIANGULO ISOSCELES

Input

The input contains three floating point numbers, A, B and C.

Output

Print all the classifications of the triangle presented in the input.
