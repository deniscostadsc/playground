You have a robot standing on the origin of x axis. The robot will be given some
instructions. Your task is to predict its position after executing all the
instructions.

LEFT: move one unit left (decrease p by 1, where p is the position of the robot
before moving)
RIGHT: move one unit right (increase p by 1)
SAME AS i: perform the same action as in the i-th instruction. It is guaranteed
that i is a positive integer not greater than the number of instructions before
this.

Input

The first line contains the number of test cases T (T <= 100). Each test case
begins with an integer n ( 1 <= n <= 100), the number of instructions. Each of
the following n lines contains an instruction.

Output

For each test case, print the final position of the robot. Note that after
processing each test case, the robot should be reset to the origin.
