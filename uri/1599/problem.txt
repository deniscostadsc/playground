Morocco is cut by the Atlas Mountains, whose highest peak is Toubkal, with 4165
meters. These mountains give rise to many stories and myths throughout
antiquity, as, for example, the 12 tasks of Hercules. Near the city of
Marrakech is what is called "high Atlas", the highest part of these mountains.

The study of the altitudes of the various peaks has been done for centuries.
Ancient Berbers documents document the recording of different altitudes of the
various points of the Atlas Mountains since the sixteenth century. The document
is a map of the region divided into quadrants. In each quadrant is noted that
the average height point. We know that a point is a peak if the height is
greater than that quadrant of its neighbors (one quadrant has up to 8).

Your task in this exercise is to read this map and identify the peaks in the
documented region.

Input

The entry consists of several instances and ends with the end of file (EOF).

Each instance corresponds to a region of the map and represented by a matrix
N x M (1 ≤ N ≤ 1.000). The first row in each instance contains the integers N
and M. For i = 1, 2,. . . N, (i + 1)-th row corresponte the i-th row of the
matrix and contains M integers separated by a space.

Output

For each instance print the coordinates of the peaks of the corresponding map,
one per line, sorted first by rows and, in case of tie, by columns. If there
are no peaks, print -1. Print a blank line at the end of each instance.
