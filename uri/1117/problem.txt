Write a program that reads two scores of a student. Calculate
and print the average of these scores. Your program must accept
only valid scores (between 0.0 and 10.0). Each score must be
validated separately.

Input

The input file contains many floating-point numbers​​, positive
or negative. The program execution will be finished after the
input of two valid scores.

Output

When an invalid score is read, you should print the message
"nota invalida".
After the input of two valid scores, the message "media = "
must be printed followed by the average of the student. The
average must be printed with 2 numbers after the decimal point.
