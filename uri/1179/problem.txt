In this problem you need to read 15 numbers and must put
them into two different arrays: par if the number is even
or impar if this number is odd. But  the size of each of the
two arrrays is only 5 positions. So every time you fill one of
two arrays, you must print the entire array to be able to use
it again for the next numbers that are read. At the end, all
remaining numbers of each one of these two arrays must be
printed beggining with the odd array. Each array can be filled
how many times are necessary.
